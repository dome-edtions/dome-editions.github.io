<h1>First Round of New Music</h1>

<h2><a name="_Toc217325363">Week 2 of 2026:</a> Music Recap</h2>

<p class=firstline>One week into the new year, it's time to check in on what's
been happening (musically-speaking) in 2026.</p>

<p class=maintext>Outside of music, it just seems like life is melting into
chaos, yet again. However, I can always rely on the unpredictability of new
times to bring on an equally varied and unexpected musical soundscape. Already
this early on, I can tell just how strange 2026 is bound to be, though I'm
unsure if I'll love it or hate it for it.</p>

<p class=maintext>Regardless, this is an example showcasing how most of the
blog posts will be organized throughout the year. I'll divide my topics into
sections detailing the new albums / songs that released during the previous
week, some artists and projects to look out for in the near future, as well as
some first time listens of mine that need to be shared. Of course, I might
start rambling about whatever feels apt at any given moment, but I'm getting
ahead of myself.</p>

<p class=maintext>For now, enjoy the first official musical recap of the year!</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc217325364">New Albums</a></h1>

<p class=album><img width=95 height=95 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"  
	src="Albums/JOOST - KLEINKUNST.jpg"
align=left hspace=12>Joost - Kleinkunst</p>

<p class=firstline>What better way to start off the year than with some Dutch
hardcore?</p>

<p class=maintext>I can't say I ever heard Joost's previous work, but this
seems like an accurate representation of his super zany character. With 24 new
songs, <b><i>Kleinkunst</i></b> will definitely take you all over the place sonically.
In a sense, it often sounds like a personal diary of sounds trying to emulate
distinct worlds Joost traveled to during tours.</p>

<p class=maintext>I can see counter-arguments against this album, but it's
honestly not a bad listen to start off your year. It's certainly cheeky, it has
some exciting beats, I love the Dutch-inspired humor he tosses in occasionally,
and there are certified banger collaborations. One in particular that surprised
me was <b><i>Farmcore</i></b> which features horsegiirL; it's such an oddball
cut, but it also perfectly represents the cookiest moments on this album in one
song.</p>

align=left hspace=12>CHUU - XO, My Cyberlove</p>

<p class=firstline>I guess you can say I'm in my k-pop era these days.</p>

<p class=maintext>Look, I'd like to formally apologize for anything negative I
might've said about this genre before even giving it a chance. Lately, it seems
like all I listen to on my down-time is k-pop related: I'm either jamming to
Twice, alternating between Lisa and Jennie's biggest songs from 2025, or
enjoying this new solo release from Chuu.</p>

<p class=maintext>For those coming into this without much background (aka me),
Chuu was part of the k-pop collective Loona, which explains a lot of the hype
behind this new release. And honestly, it's a lot of tasteful bubblegum pop in
the best way. Songs like <b><i>Limoncella</i></b> or <b><i>Teeny Tiny Heart</i></b>
just fill that pop-demanding hole in my soul, and at 26-minutes in length, the
entire album is a very trim listen that anyone could enjoy.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=95 height=95 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"  
	src="Albums/ELLENDE - ZERFALL.jpg"
align=left hspace=12>Ellende - Zerfall</p>

<p class=firstline>Starting off the year strong for metal!</p>

<p class=maintext>It won't take you very long to realize, but I'm a huge sucker
for black metal above all other subgenres in the field. I still haven't exactly
figured out <i>why</i> that is, yet I consistently gravitate toward
higher-pitched vocals with fast-paced rhythms. To that extent, the Austrian
band Ellende delivers on all my expectations for the new year.</p>

<p class=maintext>Still, this isn't your conventional black metal album. At
several points during the listen, it almost feels like the band dips into more
classical arrangements with these beautiful strings layered on top of an
underlying sonic chaos, which definitely made a lot of the earlier cuts stand
out to me strongly. I'll definitely need to give this more listens in order to dissect
its lyrics, but I'm for sure enjoying this from a sound-point as of right now.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=95 height=95 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"  
	src="Albums/VIAGRA BOYS - VIAGR ABOYS (JAPANESE DELUXE EDITION).jpg"
align=left hspace=12>Viagra Boys - viagr aboys (Japanese Deluxe Edition)</p>

<p class=firstline>There you have it: the Viagra Boys are already active in
2026, releasing a deluxe edition of their self-titled album from 2025 featuring
4 new songs for fans to enjoy.</p>

<p class=maintext>Personally, I found this album to be the most accessible from
the band yet, and I'm really glad that I've been loving it. In fact, I like it
even more now than I did when I wrote my year-end list for 2025 (I know it hasn't
been that long, but it's still grown on me a lot). There's something about the
careless attitude to the lyrics that makes these songs hilarious and punchy,
which is why I was thrilled when I saw this deluxe edition pop up in my feed.</p>

<p class=maintext>As far as the 4 new tracks go, they aim to land on the softer
side. And again, I love how the band is getting very self-referential in their
art, seemingly understanding their space in the world of music, making their
truest intentions known through grotesque images and hyper-modern frames of
mind.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=95 height=95 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"  
	src="Albums/ZACH BRYAN - WITH HEAVEN ON TOP.jpg"
align=left hspace=12>Zach Bryan - With Heaven on Top</p>

<p class=firstline>Seemingly, it's never early enough to set the bar for
quality in country music for artists like Zach Bryan.</p>

<p class=maintext>I'm always grateful when I'm reminded of this guy. Okay, I
know that his personal record lately hasn't been amazing, but he addresses this
himself all over this album. It's obvious that he's not willing to brush things
off, confronting the heat head on, which I think is a bold move most artists
wouldn't take.</p>

<p class=maintext>Other vices Zach confronts on this album includes alcohol
abuse, a topic that is heavily recurrent, coloring many of the songs here in a
dour tone of recovery. I especially love the way he portrays this cycle of
abuse through "jeans" that have circulated through his family tree, mentioning
that he needs to chop down the tree to feel free, even going as far as to flee
to Spain for a while in an attempt to correct his mindset by avoiding home.</p>

<p class=maintext>The writing on the album also dives into current affairs,
noting the worryingly divisive tensions in the USA while denouncing the way things
are heading with respect to authoritarianism, gun violence, and whatnot. It's a
stance that I don't hear many modern country artists adopt, which makes me like
Zach even more.</p>

<p class=maintext>To see both sides though, I think you'd be lying to yourself
if you didn't think of the listen as bloated. As much as I love a good Zach
Bryan album, 25 songs are a lot to commit to in one sitting, and there were
definitely some moments that felt unneeded. Songs like <b><i>Camper</i></b>
toward the back-end might offer some levity to the dark topics being discussed,
but they surely don't make me feel like extending my stay just to hear him
ramble about how sexy his new girl is. It definitely feels a little tone deaf
next to all these thoughtful and introspective dissections of the self.</p>

<p class=maintext>All in all, it's a bit early to say, but I think he's done it
again.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=95 height=95 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"  
	src="Albums/DRY CLEANING - SECRET LOVE.jpg"
align=left hspace=12>Dry Cleaning - Secret Love</p>

<p class=firstline>This is really weird... But I think I kind of like it?</p>

<p class=maintext>I'll be honest, I've never heard music sound quite like this
before. In one breath, it sounds almost like some of the more spoken-word cuts
from Wet Leg's catalogue, then in another, it kind of rings like some of my
current favorite abstract art-pop artists like Nadine Shah or even Cate Le Bon.</p>

<p class=maintext>That last comparison isn't surprising given that Cate
executively produced this entire album, to which I can attribute its drearily
impressive sound. Between droning guitar loops, ambient passages that sound like
post-music, and bare melodies to latch onto, it's not an easy listen to get
involved with. Add to that these unhinged lyrics about hitting your head all
day, eating burnt foods for pleasure, designing cruise ships to feel useful in
society, dreaming about rocks, or anything else beyond absurdity...</p>

<p class=maintext>There is indeed something strange about this album, yet I
haven't been able to put it down lately.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=95 height=95 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"  
	src="Albums/SAULT - CHAPTER 1.jpg"
align=left hspace=12>SAULT - Chapter 1</p>

<p class=firstline>I wasn't really there when the UK-based group SAULT
initially rose to prominence in the early 2020s, but I will say that the
collective's sound is feeling kind of dull this time around.</p>

<p class=maintext>I suppose a lot of that revolves around the context in which
this album was released. With Little Simz no longer associated with the project
due to tensions with Inflo (which she delves magnificently into on her latest
album <b><i>Lotus</i></b>), it seems like the producer is now left floundering
with these peppy soul beats that feel anything but soulful. Not even Cleo Sol
can save this album with her vocals given just how vapid a lot of the positive
lyricism reads as on the record.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=95 height=95 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"  
	src="Albums/THE KID LAROI - BEFORE I FORGET.jpg"
align=left hspace=12>The Kid LAROI - Before I Forget</p>

<p class=firstline>As much as I wish to love Laroi's music, there hasn't really
been anything since <b><i>Stay</i></b> that has gripped me meaningfully in any
way. I suppose it makes for an easy listen with a lot of softer passages, but
that doesn't dispel the fact that its title is essentially a self-fulfilling
prophecy: I already forgot about the album minutes past a first listen. Musically,
there's not much of substance to back the actual themes and ideas he wishes to
get across, which made it a lot more tedious than exciting to listen to.</p>

<h1>New Songs</h1>

<p class=album><img width=95 height=95 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"  
	src="Singles/A$AP ROCKY - PUNK ROCKY.jpg"
align=left hspace=12>A$AP Rocky - Punk Rocky</p>

<p class=firstline>Wait, this is actually happening!</p>

<p class=maintext>I don't think there's any more backing out now for Mr. Rocky
this time. <b><i>Don't Be Dumb</i></b> seems to be on the way (for realsies), and
I'm definitely excited to see where we'll be taken. Granted, predicting what
this album is going to sound like is becoming quite the challenge given just
how freakishly different all of Rocky's latest songs have been.</p>

<p class=maintext>This latest one <b><i>Punk Rocky</i></b> is more akin to
indie / punk rock with a very soft vocal delivery, sounding unlike anything
Rocky has ever put out before. While I'm a little bit thrown off that it's not
sounding anything like <b><i>Highjack</i></b>, I can't say that I ultimately disliked
what I heard; I'm just finding it so incredibly difficult to make any
predictions about the upcoming album!</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=95 height=95 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"  
	src="Albums/CATE LE BON - MICHELANGELO DYING.jpg"
align=left hspace=12>Cate Le Bon - Always The Same (with St. Vincent)</p>

<p class=firstline>I'll take all the leftovers I can get from this latest Cate
Le Bon era. Seemingly, she's been on an unmatched creative streak toward the
end of 2025. Alongside releasing a full album to her name (which was a
masterclass in art-pop), she also produced the Dry Cleaning album <b><i>Secret
Love</i></b> that I mentioned earlier, and she's now moving forward with this
new single that was written during the <b><i>Michelangelo Dying</i></b>
rollout. Given that St. Vincent is on the track and I've loved the sound style
from her latest album, it's no surprise that this song immediately gripped me
among the new releases of the week. In its best moments, it almost feels like
Cindy Lee was involved in part to produce such warm guitar riffs. And if this
is the precursor to an eventual deluxe version sometime in 2026, sign me up!</p>

	src="Singles/ROBYN - SEXISTENTIAL.jpg"
align=left hspace=12>Robyn - Sexistential / Talk To Me</p>

<p class=firstline>Coming back in the 2020s with an album, Robyn has been
steadily releasing singles in anticipation. However, I can't quite tell whether
I should be excited or worried for this upcoming project after hearing this
latest doublet of tracks. <b><i>Talk To Me</i></b> has this neat little electro
melody to it, though it's nothing too novel, especially for this new decade.
Then, <b><i>Sexistential</i></b> feels a bit out of touch, both in terms of how
it sounds super plain and empty, but mostly because of the overly-raunchy ramblings
about... Wanting to watch hentai...? Is that really what we're doing here? There's something
really off about this second song which worries me given that it's the album's
title track.</p>

align=left hspace=12>David Byrne &amp; Olivia Rodrigo - drivers license</p>

<p class=firstline>Look, I think this cover by David Byrne is mostly idol
worship from Olivia's behalf, which is fine. The performance itself is a little
awkward, but that doesn't detract from the warm sentiment driving the song. I'm
much more excited by the prospect of a nearby remixed version of <b><i>SOUR</i></b>
to be released in 2026 as a 5-year commemoration of the original. I can't wait
to see who else Olivia recruits for the full tracklist!</p>

<p class=album><img width=95 height=95 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"  
	src="Albums/WESLEY JOSEPH - FOREVER ENDS SOMEDAY.jpg"
align=left hspace=12>Wesley Joseph - Peace of Mind (with Danny Brown)</p>

<p class=firstline>This song right here was a legendary algorithm moment for
me! I mean, it just appeared in my feed unannounced, and I'm glad it did. I
never heard of Wesley Joseph before, but it only took one song for me to
instantly get his sound, and I'm looking forward to his debut album coming out in
April. Coming to you from the UK, he's bringing a much more atmospheric edge to
hip-hop that is sounding super fresh for the scene he's originating from. Danny
Brown's inclusion happens to be the cherry on top, though the song was already
top-notch before his distorted "check" ad-lib could be heard echoing against
the chill cloud of hazy production.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=95 height=95 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"  
	src="Singles/SARAH KINSLEY - LONELY TOUCH.jpg"
align=left hspace=12>Sarah Kinsley - Lonely Touch</p>

<p class=firstline>Well, it only took 1 week for the first of my predictions to
turn out false. It seems like Sarah Kinsley is not actually gearing up to drop
an album, but rather a 5-track EP by the name <b><i>Fleeting</i></b>.</p>

<p class=maintext>Not that I'm upset about this... Well, maybe just a little bit.
See, when your two lead singles are this high quality, I'll always be bummed to
hear that we're getting less rather than more. <b><i>Lonely Touch</i></b>
follows up on Sarah's previous single within this gloomier art-pop direction
through which she is quite vividly yearning for love. It's a song that
certainly lives up to the hype and emotion surrounding the teasers, and I'm all
ears for the full EP when the time comes.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=95 height=95 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"  
	src="Albums/BRUNO MARS - THE ROMANTIC.jpg"
align=left hspace=12>Bruno Mars - I Just Might</p>

<p class=firstline>For the most part, this is pretty standard as far as Bruno
Mars songs go. Though not as flashy as his Silk Sonic era was, it's still very
poppy and full of character. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to act
dismissive since an average Bruno cut is typically way more entertaining than
most of the radio slop you can hear nowadays. For the full album though, I
guess I would love to hear something truly different, whereas <b><i>I Just
Might</i></b> feels like he's playing things a bit safe.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=95 height=95 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"  
	src="Singles/IDK - LIFE 4 A LIFE.jpg"
align=left hspace=12>IDK - Life 4 a Life (with Pusha T)</p>

<p class=firstline>While the track isn't necessarily the most lyrically
ambitious in modern hip-hop, I can at least say it's a pretty smooth cut.
Kaytranada's production definitely helps to elevate both IDK and Pusha's
deliveries here, offering something of a more menacing vibe without disrupting
the underlying sinister groove.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=95 height=95 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"  
	src="Albums/ARI LENNOX - VACANCY.jpg"
align=left hspace=12>Ari Lennox - Twin Flame</p>

<p class=firstline>While Ari Lennox remains one of the strongest voices for contemporary
R&amp;B, I can't say she's exactly displaying her truest potential on this new song.
Sure, the atmosphere is pretty dreamy and sweet, but the lyrics feel
excessively simple in their depiction of love, way simpler than they sounded on
her 2022 album <b><i>age/sex/location</i></b>. Perhaps I haven't exactly been
stunned by these latest singles, but I'm still looking forward to the full
album coming out soon. Maybe I just need to hear these songs play out in sequence
to fully capture her vision.</p>

	src="Singles/TESSA VIOLET - KNOWING.jpg"
align=left hspace=12>Tessa Violet - Knowing</p>

<p class=firstline>Now that's a name I haven't heard in a while! The last time
Tessa Violet crossed my mind was with her smash hit <b><i>Crush</i></b> all the
way back in the pre-pandemic days. In the years since then, she's seemingly
gone through a whole journey of self-discovery and whatnot, all of which she
dives into on this new track. At its core, I really love the central message of
"knowing this isn't enough is enough" that resonates throughout, and even
musically it feels like something very new to hear. I'm definitely intrigued to
see if more comes out of this era of Tessa's life.</p>

align=left hspace=12>Father John Misty - The Old Law</p>

<p class=firstline>This new song by Father John Misty pretty much sticks to
what makes him such a great artist. While not straying too far from the style
of <b><i>Mahashmashana</i></b> back in late 2024, <b><i>The Old Law</i></b> sounds
like a song that easily could've made that tracklist due to its similar
structure, vocal performance, and abstract lyrical displays.</p>
