<h2><a name="_Toc217325363">Preamble</a></h2>

<p class=firstline>2025 has been a little strange compared to recent years. In
a sense, I haven't gotten a real break since the start of summer.</p>

<p class=maintext>Constantly being busy is a new-ish feeling to me, which is
why I'm surprised I managed to maintain a regular schedule of new album
listens. I guess that's something that won't ever change. So long as new music
gets released, I'll always spare some time for discovery since it's something I
enjoy doing too much to entirely disregard. I'd like to think it keeps me
creative, or at the very least occupied as I wait for life to wrap back around.</p>

<p class=maintext>And I suppose I haven't been <i>that</i> busy if I managed to
compile these lists alongside fulfilling my other responsibilities. Listening
to nearly 400 newly-released albums in one year is impressive. Although I don't
mean to undersell that feat, what's even stranger to consider is that this
number represents only a measly fraction of the uncountable selection of albums
that released in 2025, and I've yet to fully appreciate just how tiny the dent
I've made in the music world truly is.</p>

<p class=maintext>This year, I've worked hard on expanding my genre collection,
to varying degrees of success. I guess you can only venture so far beyond your
comfort zone before your favorite releases start looking like all of your past
obsessions. Still, I tried my best to redact lists that summarize each little
sound pocket I've explored this year, from blends of shoegaze and black metal
to progressive folk infused with a country spin.</p>

<p class=maintext>As always, if I missed any obvious blind spots, do let me
know, and I'll make sure to give them a listen in due time. Regardless, I hope
you enjoy reading along because organizing, writing, and overthinking these
lists is always a highlight of my year.</p>

<p class=maintext>Who knows? Maybe you'll uncover something to drag into 2026
with you!</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc217325364">Deluxe Versions</a></h1>

<p class=firstline>To begin, I'd like to shout-out some deluxe album versions
released this year that had me the most excited to revisit older albums I've
always enjoyed. In no particular order, here are my top picks in this category.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=97 height=97 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"
src="Albums/LUNA LI - WHEN A THOUGHT GROWS WINGS REIMAGINED.jpg" style="border: 2px solid rgb(222, 246, 188)" align=left hspace=12
alt="LUNA LI - WHEN A THOUGHT GROWS WINGS REIMAGINED">Luna
Li - When a Thought Grows Wings (Reimagined)</p>

<p class=firstline>Though her original album back in 2024 didn't make my top
100 list at the time, it wasn't far off, and I still found myself sporadically
revisiting tracks like "Confusion Song" or "Minnie Says" this year. I guess
what really sold this <i>reimagined</i> version to me are all the tiny creative
and musical updates Luna Li added to any given song, whether it be a slightly
modified backing instrument or simply a stunning collaboration (most notably
the reimagined version of "Fantasy" with Raveena). I was even a fan of that
cute medley of jams near the end, and this updated tracklist makes me feel very
strongly about her potential as an art pop great of the near future.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=97 height=97 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"
src="Albums/LUPE FIASCO - SAMURAI DX.jpg" style="border: 2px solid rgb(222, 246, 188)" align=left hspace=12
alt="A person holding a sword&#10;&#10;AI-generated content may be incorrect.">Lupe
Fiasco - Samurai DX</p>

<p class=firstline>To this day, <i>Samurai</i> remains one of my most played
rap albums from 2024, so I was (obviously) thrilled to hear that it was getting
an extension. Lupe took his sound in an even more instrumentally-smooth
direction on this deluxe edition, providing us with jazzed-up remixes of
"Samurai" and "Palaces" which are gorgeous. Not only that, but this deluxe
package also featured great extra cuts that continue to prove that Lupe is
still a top-tier lyricist and musical visionary.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=97 height=97 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"
src="Albums/CARLY RAE JEPSEN - EMOTION 10TH ANNIVERSARY.jpg" style="border: 2px solid rgb(222, 246, 188)" align=left hspace=12>Carly
Rae Jepsen - Emotion (10<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Edition)</p>

<p class=firstline>New CRJ is always something I'm up for! And with <i>Emotion</i>
being one of the pop albums that defines me the best, hearing some extra tracks
from this era made me feel nostalgic in a really warm and positive way. It was
even nice to see "Cut To The Feeling" finally land on an official album, ending
its reign as a single almost a decade later.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=97 height=97 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"
src="Albums/JPEGMAFIA & DANNY BROWN - SCARING THE HOES DIRECTORS CUT.jpg" style="border: 2px solid rgb(222, 246, 188)" align=left hspace=12>JPEGMAFIA
&amp; Danny Brown - Scaring the Hoes: Director's Cut</p>

<p class=firstline>Back in 2023, the duo's original collab album went absolute
insane, and it's still such an odd, funny, and chaotic listen whenever I decide
to revisit it. That same year, they released a <i>DLC Pack</i> of 4 extra
tracks which were neat, but they never really explained how the cuts were meant
to intertwine with the rest of the tracklist.</p>

<p class=maintext>That's where this Director's Cut thrives for me: I absolutely
loved the way the DLC songs fit into the mix with the original material. To my
ears, it makes the record's ending even more satisfying and well-paced. Even if
the other 3 extra tracks tacked onto the end weren't anything too special, I
still appreciate the resolved sequencing of the deluxe material!</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=97 height=97 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"
src="Albums/JPEGMAFIA - ILDMLFY DIRECTOR'S CUT.jpg" style="border: 2px solid rgb(222, 246, 188)" align=left hspace=12>JPEGMAFIA
- I Lay Down My Life for You: Director's Cut</p>

<p class=firstline>Speaking of JPEGMAFIA, he also released a very lengthy
add-on to his 2024 rap-rock hybrid album super early in 2025. Despite many of
the tracks ringing a little like noisy filler, I was surprised to see just how
many great ideas were scrapped from the official album (especially that
extended intro into the first song and the title track itself). Hearing fully
uncut versions like this make me realize how difficult the trimming process
before official releases must truly be.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=97 height=97 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"
src="Albums/SZA - SOS DELUXE LANA.jpg" style="border: 2px solid rgb(222, 246, 188)" align=left hspace=12>SZA
- SOS Deluxe: LANA</p>

<p class=firstline>Technically this album's reissue came out in late 2024, but
I'm counting it for 2025 since I listened to it a decent amount toward the
start of the year. As much as <i>SOS</i> is an album that I'm still a bit mixed
on, I'll at least admit that the deluxe tracks captured a style very reflective
of SZA's music that I'm easily pulled toward. Plus, it was cool to hear her
collaborate with Kendrick Lamar on "30 For 30" after seeing her massively
contribute to <i>GNX's </i>success. Overall, I think this was a solid booster,
despite feeling far removed from the original it's attached to.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc217325365">EPs</a></h1>

<p class=firstline>Next up, I'll touch on several EPs that marked me throughout
the year. Here, I considered any self-described "EPs" from artists that have
piqued my interest enough to merit my curiosity for their future releases. I
also included a fair share of familiar faces which are becoming regulars on my
most-enjoyed lists. Generally, my appreciation of these selections increases as
you near the bottom of this section.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=97 height=97 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"
src="Albums/JAE SKEESE - 40 HOURS.jpg" style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)" align=left hspace=12>Jae
Skeese - 40 Hours</p>

<p class=firstline>These days, it seems like Jae Skeese is always on the grind.
Not only did he release relatively strong albums in 2023 and 2024, but he also
dished out this collection of tracks in the first month of 2025, making for an
impressive track record by today's standards.</p>

<p class=maintext>On these 7 songs, he continues to garner support from me
thanks to his clever imagery (especially on that "Rotary Phone" song) and solid
beat selections. So, even if he's not necessarily reinventing his sound from
ground level, I was happy to hear more from him on such short notice.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album>Logic - Aquarius III<img width=97 height=97 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"
src="Albums/LOGIC - AQUARIUS III.jpg" style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)" align=left hspace=12></p>

<p class=firstline>As a quick follow-up to 2024's <i>Ultra 85</i>, these 5 new
tracks expand on what made that album such a fun rap project. Maybe the first
two tracks feature some weaker choruses, but I still hold that "Not A Game"
with Lucy Rose's wonderful vocals and "Universe" with its captivating groove
picked out the best sonic characteristics from this era.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album>TYLA - WWP<img width=97 height=97 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"
src="Albums/TYLA - WWP.jpg" style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"  align=left hspace=12></p>

<p class=firstline>Essentially, these 4 tracks sound like some of the most
energetic and upbeat cuts from Tyla's debut album back in 2024. Being as I was
a big fan of that album, I carried over much of that same love toward this new
EP of hers. What's interesting is that Tyla is sounding a lot more commanding
and charismatic through her vocals, making her deliveries pop significantly
(just listen to a song like "Mr. Media" and you'll hear what I mean).</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album>BB Trickz - 80'z<img width=97 height=97 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"
src="Albums/BB TRICKZ - 80'Z.jpg" style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)" align=left hspace=12></p>

<p class=firstline>I've seen this EP getting some strange backlash, so I
definitely feel the need to come to its defense. I only heard of BB Trickz for
the first time on the <i>BRAT</i> remix album in 2024, and listening to a full-ish
project from her made me even more intrigued about her artistic style. She has
this unconventional way of writing short songs with smooth flows and an
almost-muted vocal track over which she raps / sings. Overall, I was pretty
impressed with the uniqueness of her style, which makes me want to hear what
she'll put out next (maybe in a longer form).</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album>Yeat - Dangerous Summer<img width=97 height=97 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"
src="Albums/YEAT - DANGEROUS SUMMER.jpg" style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)" align=left hspace=12
alt="A person with tattoos on his arm and a large crocodile&#10;&#10;AI-generated content may be incorrect."></p>

<p class=firstline><i>Dangerous Summer</i> pretty much sees Yeat doing what
Yeat does best. However, unlike on most of his albums where the rage-based
production feels oversaturated and a bit aimless, the instrumental
presentations on this EP work to elevate whichever feature artist lands on a given
track, be it FKA twigs, Don Toliver, or any number of faces making an
appearance on this tape.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=97 height=97 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"
src="Albums/JANE REMOVER - (2025) HEART.jpg" style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)" align=left hspace=12
alt="A person leaning out of a car window&#10;&#10;AI-generated content may be incorrect.">Jane
Remover - &#9829;</p>

<p class=firstline>Even though most of these songs have been out for well over a
year now, it's nice to hear Jane Remover finally compile them into an EP. When <i>Revengeseekerz</i>
dropped earlier this year, I remember feeling sad that <i>Flash In The Pan</i>
and <i>Magic I Want U</i> never landed on an official release, so I can rest
assured that it happened at last. As for the EP itself, it is a lot more
pop-friendly than you'd expect, featuring some really sweet melodies and lyrics
that underscore Jane's most accessible and creative side yet!</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album>Kilo Kish - Negotiations<img width=97 height=97 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"
src="Albums/KILO KISH - NEGOTIATIONS.jpg" style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)" align=left hspace=12></p>

<p class=firstline>Going in a synth / electro-pop direction with these new
songs, Kilo Kish is sounding fantastic! The beats are crisp, her vocals are
impressive, and there's a unity to the technological theming she struck on this
particular EP. If anything, I'd love to hear her expand on this style in the
future, even though it's already immensely enjoyable in its current state.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=97 height=97 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"
src="Albums/MIKAYLA GEIER - (2025) HOT POT.jpg" style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)" align=left hspace=12
alt="A drawing of a person's face in a bowl of soup with chopsticks&#10;&#10;AI-generated content may be incorrect.">Mikayla
Geier - HOT POT!</p>

<p class=firstline>Immediately, I knew this EP was going to be amazing after
hearing only the first song. Mikayla Geier is the type of artist you just <i>know
</i>is gonna be big one day. Her over-the-top performances are only the tip of
the iceberg, with her talent extending to creating genuinely sticky pop songs.
There's not really a weak hook nor low point to be found here: <i>HOT POT</i>
is just super impressive and to the point!</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=97 height=97 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"
src="Albums/KELLY LEE OWENS - (2025) KELLY.jpg" style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)" align=left hspace=12
alt="A close-up of a person's back&#10;&#10;AI-generated content may be incorrect.">Kelly
Lee Owens - KELLY</p>

<p class=firstline>Techno done right! On her self-titled EP, Kelly Lee Owens
really showcases what makes her an excellent producer with the sharp song
structures of her club anthems. It really feels like she took the best instrumental
jams and ideas from her 2024 album and compiled them into an EP that makes you
want to move and jump along to every passing moment.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album>Ethel Cain - Perverts<img width=97 height=97 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"
src="Albums/ETHEL CAIN - PERVERTS.jpg" style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)" align=left hspace=12></p>

<p class=firstline>Technically, this is an EP, even though it would rank
amongst the longest pieces of music I've heard this year (if not <i>the</i>
longest). Admittedly, I have not revisited this EP all that much, but listening
to this for the first time marked one of my most memorable days back in January
when it came out.</p>

<p class=maintext>Here's what I'll say: listening to <i>Perverts</i> is not an
easy task. Its soundscape is cold, uninviting, borderline terrifying, and
you'll find yourself wondering whether your sanity is still intact the longer
you listen. It features long spans without vocals with the space being filled
up by droning noise and dark ambient pauses, but this precise combination becomes
the perfect backdrop for gloomy morning wandering and contemplative nostalgia.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album>Nil&#252fer Yanya - Dancing Shoes<img width=97 height=97 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"
src="Albums/NILUFER YANYA - DANCING SHOES.jpg" style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)" align=left hspace=12></p>

<p class=firstline>Unsurprisingly, my EP of the year.</p>

<p class=maintext>I say unsurprisingly because of how highly I praised
Nil&#252fer's 2024 album, placing it in my top 10 last year. In a way, this EP
feels like remnants from the <i>Method Actor </i>era that sounded a bit too
out-of-place to merge into the full album.</p>

<p class=maintext>But as an EP, these 4 songs hit the spot. From the entrancing
guitar rhythms on "Kneel" to the shoegaze (yes, you heard that right) influence
all over the very fuzzy "Where To Look", <i>Dancing Shoes </i>feels like a
long-lost companion to her 2024 album, one that adds a new dimension of
versatile sound while retaining everything that made her lyrics so fascinating
in the first place.</p>

<p class=maintext>I can't even begin to describe how often I've played this EP;
just know that it's more than a lot. Nil&#252fer Yanya is simply one of those
generational artists that everyone needs to hear about.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc217325366">Honorable Mentions</a></h1>

<p class=firstline>Of course, I like to round off this medley of introductory
sections by naming a few of my honorable mentions for 2025. Although these
albums didn't make my final top 100 albums list, I feel like they're still
worth a mention for some reason or another. Without any further preamble (which
there has been a lot already), here are the entries I picked out.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album>Offset - KIARI<img width=97 height=97 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"
src="Albums/OFFSET - KIARI.jpg" style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)" align=left hspace=12></p>

<p class=firstline>An album that particularly surprised me in 2025 was this new
one from Offset. While typically an artist that I've only enjoyed in passing or
in short feature bursts, I was quite impressed with just how thoughtful the
lyrics and beat selections were on this album. Perhaps not every guest nor tune
is the most successful (especially given its rather lengthy runtime), but I
still left the album with quite a handful of tracks that ranked among my
favorite songs of the year, as well as with a renewed outlook on Offset as a commendable
solo artist.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album>Mamalarky - Hex Key<img width=97 height=97 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)" style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"
src="Albums/MAMALARKY - HEX KEY.jpg" align=left hspace=12></p>

<p class=firstline>Using high-contrast sounds and saturated melodies, Mamalarky
made a bold statement with its particular pop brand that hits all the emotional
highs and lows you'd expect from a modern indie album. If they were to refine
their sound to be a bit more consistent across the runtime, I'm sure they'll
soon be putting out some of the hardest hitting pop tunes of the next few
years. </p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album>Jim Legxacy - Black British Music (2025)<img width=97 height=97 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"
src="Albums/JIM LEGXACY - BLACK BRITISH MUSIC (2025).jpg" align=left hspace=12></p>

<p class=firstline>Whether through melodic singing or with his signature UK
hip-hop flow, Jim Legxacy is a force to reckon with on this new mixtape. I
especially enjoyed how introspective a lot of his writing was on these tracks,
tackling relationships, upbringings, and family dynamics, sometimes all in the
same song!</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album>Richard Dawson - End of the Middle<img width=97 height=97 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"
src="Albums/RICHARD DAWSON - END OF THE MIDDLE.jpg" align=left hspace=12></p>

<p class=firstline>On <i>End of the Middle</i>, Richard Dawson continues doing
what he does best using a noticeably moodier underlying sound. Often, it feels
very dire yet inviting, almost as though he's gathering us all together before
singing us a lullaby or putting a story from his past into light. I can't say
that I was blown away by all the songs here, but the album made me curious
enough to want to explore his discography in more depth in the coming year.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album>Jennie - Ruby<img width=97 height=97 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"
src="Albums/JENNIE - RUBY.jpg" align=left hspace=12></p>

<p class=firstline>As much as I feel like Jennie is still growing and finding
her own voice, <i>Ruby</i> is a great start toward achieving that goal. With
some interesting feature combinations and a nice balance between energetic and
moody, it feels like a compelling homage to herself. I bet she'll really wow us
in the future when she works on perfecting her solo performances just a bit
more.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album>Sn&#245&#245per - Worldwide<img width=97 height=97 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"
src="Albums/SNOOPER - WORLDWIDE.jpg" align=left hspace=12
alt="A logo on a pink background&#10;&#10;AI-generated content may be incorrect."></p>

<p class=firstline>This album's full of charm, and I really enjoyed how the
band kept the tracklist succinct by trimming off whatever might have lacked in
quality. Seriously, it's compact and full of energy from start to finish, which
makes me want to hear even more from this uniquely rough-around-the-edges punk duo.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album>Panchiko - Ginkgo<img width=97 height=97 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"
src="Albums/PANCHIKO - GINKGO.jpg" align=left hspace=12
alt="A child with a white shirt&#10;&#10;AI-generated content may be incorrect."></p>

<p class=firstline>To me, it sounds like the band is operating at its best on
Ginkgo: the cute sonic palettes used on many tracks sound shimmering, the
stickiness of the lyrics prevails across most songs, and there's a subtle
comfort in hearing something so bright and positive for once.</p>

effectively doubles-up on their incredible album <i>Haram</i> from 2021. I will
say, the group feels a little sleepier than usual, perhaps due to just how
chill this particular set of Alchemist beats comes across as. There are
nonetheless quite a few highlights to marvel at, notably the bright uptick on
"Moonbow". I still would've loved to hear a tad more energy from everyone
involved.</p>

<p class=firstline>Contrary to what most might say, I actually preferred this
to 2024's <i>Short N Sweet</i>. Maybe it's because I'm used to Sabrina's
excessively-horny vibe by now, but her stick feels a lot more genuine now than
it did last year. Another thing I've noticed is that the instrumentals
themselves are a lot more varied, touching on disco and sounding
country-inspired in other bouts. Though it's not exactly among my favorite pop
showings of the year, I can't say that I was displeased hearing the hits being
played on the radio this time around.</p>

<p class=firstline>Ok, you caught me! Rest assured though, this is not me
performing. I'm just a sucker for Laufey's particular style of modern jazz, and
this new album of hers continues this streak for me, admittedly with a little
less novelty than when she first came on the scene. I also really loved the
theming around time, clocks, and fairytales across the tracklist; it makes for
a cute album to play on a calm evening.</p>

<p class=firstline>A new Yeule album can't be a bad thing! Although this one
doesn't feel as sonically cohesive as their works tend to be, there are still
quite a few moments that kept me coming back occasionally (most notably the
brilliantly poppy "Eko" and the one-two combo of the closing tracks that are
just incredible).</p>

(Self-titled)</p>

<p class=firstline>This new band largely directed by sisters Katie and Alison
Crutchfield essentially recorded one of the more easy-going country albums of
2025. Though it's not as immediately captivating as Waxahatchee's <i>Tigers

<p class=firstline>As much as this album lacks the punchier highlights from his
more classic works, I still feel like <i>Ain't No Damn Way</i> acts like a
transition back toward the typical KAYTRANADA-like aesthetics that I adored
from his debut. Given just how purely this tracklist flows, its beats and
grooves definitely make for a great tone-setter or background listen.</p>

<p class=firstline>Similar to the previous album, I find <i>Essex Honey</i> to
sound much better in the background given its generalized melancholic vibe.
With generous contributions by Caroline Polachek, Mustafa, Lorde, and even Mabe
Fratti, the soundscape feels rich, albeit a tad bit woozy and easy to get lost
into.</p>

<p class=firstline>With its whimsical aura and frosty atmosphere, <i>Iris
Silver Mist </i>was one of my favorite art pop albums to return to in 2025,
despite sounding a little more like backing noise at times. Using a similar
soundscape you'd expect on any number of Julia Holter albums, Jenny Hval
manages to weave these pillowy instrumentals using her voice to knit the whole
experience together with some rambled afterthoughts.</p>

Point Never - Tranquilizer</p>

<p class=firstline>Staying true to his signature sound, OPN's <i>Tranquilizer</i>
is an hour-long journey into the depths of the bright producer's creative mind
put on full display over this intricate set of instrumentals. Perhaps I've
listened to this one a bit more passively than I wish I had, but it's still
definitely worth a mention given just how often I played it toward this year's

<p class=firstline>Absolutely wild and entertaining, <i>Revengeseekerz</i> was
impossible for me to avoid in 2025. Perhaps it's not the melodic pop album I
was anticipating from Jane; it was nonetheless interesting to hear her venture
into rage music with a distinctly experimental electronic approach. I guess the
one downside to this album for me is just how saturated and overstimulating it
sounds, which makes every listen feel a lot more overwhelming than I'd hoped.
That doesn't discredit the massive highlights that really blew apart my mind
and my year for the better!</p>

Winter - Heavy Metal</p>

<p class=firstline>Last, but certainly not least, a massive honorable mention goes
to Cameron Winter's debut project <i>Heavy Metal</i>. Despite having enjoyed the
last Geese album <i>3D Country</i>, I wasn't too enthralled by this solo
release back when it dropped in late 2024. It's only when I revisited the album
later in the summer of 2025 that I realized I'd sidelined a truly remarkable
display of lyricism, vulnerability, and uncategorizably strange emotion.</p>

<p class=maintext>Obviously, this album is not for everyone; Cameron's odd
singing alone might be enough of a roadblock to most listeners. However, if you
are willing to give this project the time of day, I guarantee that you'll find
yourself crying at 4 AM, repeating to yourself that you're nothing more than a
0$ man. Take it from personal experience, would you?</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc217325367">Main Song List</a></h1>

<p class=firstline>Before getting into my top albums, I also like to compile a
list of my favorite songs in any given year. Obviously, I haven't listened to <i>all</i>
the songs that released in 2025, that's just absurd (and I don't think anyone
will ever be physically capable of achieving that).</p>

<p class=maintext>However, I was relatively broad with my search, and I tried
to capture a wide range of the music I've enjoyed throughout the year. Despite
a lot of overlap with my albums list, I think there are a few hidden gems here
that you might not have heard of. Again, I'd highly encourage you to check out
any of the songs that intrigue you on this list!</p>

<p class=firstline>Though <i>Forever Is a Feeling</i> didn't land on my best

one of the key tracks on the record that showcases the specific sad-girl brand
of music that describes Lucy Dacus the best. It's her sharp lyricism mixed with
her ability to paint a compelling emotional portrait that sells the song so
effectively.</p>

The Mar&#237as - Back to Me</p>

<p class=firstline>Building on what made <i>Submarine</i> such a successful
lofi-pop album, the band delivered what sound like a few extra tracks from this
album cycle earlier in 2025. Among these, <i>Back to Me</i> in particular stood
out as having such a sticky vocal melody to it; I could listen to that hook all

<p class=firstline>Making a bid for the earliest hit of 2025 (having released just
shy of the New Year), Redveil is sounding fully re-energized on this new

this point!</p>

<p class=firstline>Honestly, after <i>TTPD</i>, I'm just glad to have enjoyed some
crumbs of this new Taylor Swift era. Thanks to Max Martin's helm on the
production side of things, many songs on her latest album actually sound
vibrant, as any good pop tune should. My personal pick on the album would have
to be <i>Opalite</i> due to its supremely catchy chorus and great underlying

<p class=firstline>Picking just one song as a favorite off Tyla's <i>WWP</i> EP
is tough, and I still don't know if I made the right choice. Maybe that says
more about the overall quality of the project, but I ultimately went with Mr.
Media due to how charismatic she sounds in her delivery. I'd love to hear her

BB Trickz - Not a Pretty Girl</p>

<p class=firstline>Using Clairo's <i>Pretty Girl</i> as an underlying sample,
BB Trickz exudes character as she raps in this silky, almost hushed manner. The
track is quiet, cute, really sticky, but unfortunately quite short. As I noted
in the EP section, I really want to hear her expand on this type of sound in a
longer format because there's a lot of potential here just begging to be
optimized.</p>

<p class=firstline>It took me a while to come around to Wet Leg given just how peculiar
their particular style of indie rock is, and I can confidently say that <i>Catch

perspective. It's such a banger with strong guitars and a constantly evolving
vocal lead.</p>

Chappell's latest track <i>The Subway</i> is just about as grandiose in its

Pink Siifu - Girls Fall Outta the Sky</p>

<p class=firstline>As strange as Pink Siifu's latest album was, it surely led
to some of the most experimental and ambitious pockets of contemporary hip-hop.
Though there were several tracks fighting for this spot, I went with <i>Gils
Fall Outta the Sky</i> due to just how effective this beat is at pulling you
into its dramatic atmosphere. You really get a sense of dread whenever those
drums finally kick in; it's so satisfying in that regard.</p>

<p class=firstline>With <i>Manchild</i>, Sabrina Carpenter yet again managed to
score a lot of mainstream plays on the radio and whatnot. However, I'll
reiterate it again, I'm not too angry whenever I hear this get air in public
because it's quite a fun song. I love how she leans heavily into country
aesthetics which fit her voice incredibly well, and I also think it's one of
the cheekier songs she's written that truly sells its humor.</p>

<p class=firstline><i>A Matter of Time</i> featured a lot of very classic
sounding Laufey songs, though the one that stood out the most had to be <i>Clean
Air</i> because its lyrics are just so witty and cute. Singing from the
perspective of leaving a toxic relationship using visuals of "needing clean

all performed so tastefully.</p>

Lupe Fiasco - High Note</p>

<p class=firstline>I'm telling you, Lupe Fiasco is just too talented for his
own good. <i>Samurai DX</i> added a bunch of new tracks to expand the original
album, though <i>High Note</i> has to be my favorite given its smooth
progression and just how lush the vocals are sounding. Luv Moore's
contributions to the hook also help to elevate the musicality of the ensemble,
and Lupe continues rapping with his typical high level of finesse.</p>

Miya Folick - Felicity</p>

<p class=firstline>Wow, what a gorgeous song! Genuinely, that's the first
thought that still pops up in my mind, no matter how many times I listen to it.
There's just something so pretty about the drums, the vocals, the general sense
of serenity transpiring through the subtle instruments ringing in the
background. To my ears, this is handily Miya's most impressive song to date,
and I'd love for her to expand on this formula in the near future. Gorgeous,
indeed. </p>

Silvana Estrada - Dime</p>

<p class=firstline>There's a reason Silvana Estrada is one of a few select
modern Spanish-speaking artists who managed to broaden their appeal to
English-speaking audiences, and I think a lot of her success in that respect
has to do with just how easy her music is to love. You don't really need to
understand what is being said on <i>Dime</i> to love it, though that certainly helps
to love it more. Through sheer vocal expressivity alone, Silvana paints emotion
so vividly; it's quite a spectacle to hear!</p>

definitely don't want you to miss out on this extra track that didn't make the

winding the melodic loop is, and the French-sung vocals are just so sticky,
they'll actually tickle your brain for hours at a time if you're not careful
enough.</p>

<p class=firstline>Please don't forget about this song! Yes, I know Alfredo 2
was a massive album this year, but this surprise solo Freddie song released on
Valentine's Day makes for such a passive-aggressive statement as he plays with
the lyric "nobody likes you" in a clever way. Hands down an impressive,
borderline romantic, performance by Mr. Gibbs, and the love-centric thematic

<p class=firstline>Post-rock meets shoegaze, and the combination is just

so admirable in the lane of expansive rock: its tremendous knack for escalation
as it piles on more and more distorted guitars into the mix leaves me
speechless by the track's ending on every listen. The culmination of all that
sound just takes you to another sonic universe in the process.</p>

Brian D'Addario, one of the twin brothers fronting the band, released a solo
effort this year, and I enjoyed a great deal of the songs on it. <i>Song of
Everyone</i> especially captures this kind of jolly / nostalgic sound that made
me fall in love with the Twigs in the first place. It feels like a song
carrying an old soul, channeling long-lost decades in the process through its
comforting tune.</p>

instantaneous. Lady Gaga is one of those artists that will release heat, and it
doesn't really matter what kind of style they venture into, nor if they're
saying actual words for that matter. The lead single to the <i>Mayhem</i> era
throws things back to her earliest hits, taking listeners onto a journey toward
electro-pop and highly dynamic performances in the process.</p>

<p class=firstline>After having enjoyed her art pop debut <i>Escaper</i> in
2024, my hopes were pretty high for Sarah Kinsley as an upcoming artist. Surely
enough, this latest single <i>Fleeting</i> leading into her next big album only
helped to amplify these hopes thanks to its shimmering synth layers, incredibly
catchy vocal switches, and inarguable sensation of freedom. The word itself, <i>fleeting</i>,
is so apt for precisely describing the feelings on her mind.</p>

<p class=firstline>In a year where Aesop Rock was busy enough to release 2 full
length albums, I think the song worth noting the most among his impressive
output is this solo track <i>Roadwork Rappin'</i> which came and went quietly.
At least, for most it did, but it truly struck a chord with me in a strong way.
Yet again, I'm astounded at how Aesop can rap about anything with a laser
focus, this time going off about construction vehicles and literal roadwork...
You couldn't ask me to make this up, but clearly some artists are just more
creative than I am when it comes to innovating.</p>

gloomy... Look, all I can say with certainty is that I love this song so much.</p>

<p class=firstline>My highlight on <i>Magic Alive</i> might seem like an odd
pick to most, but I can't get enough of the rhyme scheme on that hook! The
pattern Alfred establishes is one of the sharpest I've heard in 2025, and I
love how McKinley and Ghais match this zaniness in their respective verses. Not
to mention, the beat on this track is absolute insanity, with irregular horns
blaring, squeaking sonics, and generally the vibe it presents is too difficult
to even classify. I'd rather just enjoy the show and keep hitting replay
instead of dissecting it any further.</p>

<p class=firstline>What a forward-thinking electronic banger by Kilo Kish!
Aside from kicking off a killer EP she released earlier this year, <i>Digital
Emotional</i> stands alone as a powerful single depicting the idea of hanging
onto one's emotional intelligence in a world increasingly surrounded by all
things digital and artificial. Seeing her write from a more conceptual
perspective really blew my mind, and I can't stress how much I'd wish for a
full album's worth of material like this track.</p>

to hear from in the new year is Lexa Gates. Having released 4 incredible
singles in the leadup to her upcoming album, I'm really starting to understand
the appeal of her persona, or at the very least a lot more than I did at the
time of her debut album in 2024. <i>Past It</i> was probably my favorite single
due to its chipmunk soul sample paired with Lexa's faster-paced delivery, and I'll
definitely be listening to her new music on day one!</p>

who dropped a super fun mixtape filled with a bunch of cute little bops. Among
these tracks, the lead single <i>Tonight</i> was my favorite due to its genius
looped sample, the surprisingly raunchy lyrical approach, and the super
exciting progression from verses to chorus. Simply put, it's one of the most
fun songs you'll have a chance to hear this year, and I'd be doing a bad job

<p class=firstline>Speaking of incredibly fun songs, my year-end lists wouldn't
be complete without an underscores inclusion somewhere. Though she didn't
release any new project, I must say, the 2 singles she <i>did</i> put out were
both some of the most exciting dance-pop tunes I've heard in 2025. <i>Music</i>
is great, and I think <i>Do It</i> only edges it out slightly because it
allowed us to witness April performing choreo (seriously, a highlight of my
year). Regardless of favorites, both of these snippets have me super excited
for a future album that encapsulates the shared potential of these dancier
tunes!</p>

<p class=firstline>Honestly, I didn't expect to love this song as much as I
did, but no trap song has gone as supremely hard in 2025. The sampled vocals in
tandem with those ferocious guitars make this a perfect example of how to
correctly write a rap / rock hybrid. Also, JID is a name that'll be popping up
on this list pretty frequently given just how many amazing features he had this

after quotable in a slick and calculated manner. </p>

Blondshell - T&amp;A</p>

<p class=firstline>Though it took me a while to fall in love with her full
album, I pretty much understood the appeal for <i>T&amp;A</i> on impact.
Truthfully, it's because I liked this song so much that I gave Blondshell's
album more listens later on in the year. It recounts this kind of bittersweet
love scenario featuring some toxic individuals who don't fully reciprocate any
form of emotional intimacy, yet she somehow finds herself drawn toward this
connection rather than resorting to vacancy instead. It's definitely one of the
most interestingly-written dynamics on any love song of 2025, and Sabrina's
vocal performance helps to sell the emotional potency behind the track's
message.</p>

twisting sounds and morphemes into something that looks simple, even though it couldn't
be any less difficult when you actually try to follow in his footsteps. I also
love Haley's added vocal harmonies to the track, boosting the texture in Max'

the lyrics let on.</p>

Tyler Childers - Bitin' List</p>

<p class=firstline>My pick for funniest song of 2025!</p>

<p class=maintext>Tyler Childers is the kind of artist that you grow to love
more and more with each passing release, and <i>Snipe Hunter</i> brought on a
new era to his sound that fits him like a glove. <i>Bitin' List</i> might just
be the reigning example of how charismatic he can be, depicting himself hypothetically
catching rabies, and then redacting a list of people he dislikes that he'd bite
during his final days. It's a hilarious concept song that doesn't compromise on
its great performance either.</p>

<p class=firstline>With a roster this stacked, I just knew this song was going
to be a stunner! Granted, I expected their combined glam and the power to result
in a complete showstopper; what we instead got was a soft ballad during which
the three singers deliver one pleasant verse after the next, alternating
between English and Spanish in a very casual kind of way. Yet, despite the song
sounding a lot different than I'd envisioned it in my mind initially, that
doesn't change the fact that this is easily one of the hardest-hitting love
songs of 2025, and that chorus is just so beautifully smooth.</p>

most played albums of the decade, it's no surprise that I'll enjoy pretty much
anything that Nil&#252fer puts out these days. On her latest EP, <i>Where to Look</i>
is the most interesting track, which mixes up her standard singer-songwriter
acoustic style for some electric guitars that sound noisy, downright shoegazy
if I'm being honest. It's a heavy song that carries a lot of the emotional
burden the EP seems to be dealing with, and hearing Nil&#252fer experiment musically
on this side project keeps me thinking of her highly heading into the new year.</p>

Sudan Archives - My Type</p>

<p class=firstline>Maybe <i>The BPM</i> itself was a bit hit or miss for me,
but <i>My Type</i> was an undeniable single, and it still remains such a killer
dance anthem. I guess you can say it's really my type of music!</p>

<p class=maintext>Corny puns aside, there's something so creative about the
instrumental on this track. Whether it's the loud percussion hits or the way
the song phases between bouts of calm and rushes or energy, there's a lot to
take in on the listener's side. Personally, I feel like this song distills why
Sudan Archives is such an unpredictable artist, making it seem like she can do
it all, and then some more.</p>

El Michels Affair &amp; Clairo - Anticipate</p>

<p class=firstline>Clearly, Clairo and Leon Michels need to make more songs
together. Obviously, <i>Charm</i> was a huge success, but hearing this extra
track here reminded me precisely why this combination excels in complementing
each other's respective styles: Leon's glitzy, downright pretty instrumental is
exactly what allows Clairo's soft vocal approach to shine the brightest.
Although songs like <i>Anticipate</i> don't have to reinvent the formula to
sound great, they make for very easy listens, quick replays... And would this
year-end list really be complete without Clairo appearing somewhere?</p>

<p class=firstline>Mabe Fratti over electric guitars. Need I say more?</p>

<p class=maintext>I suppose I shall. Toward the middle of the summer, I found
out the band <i>Titanic</i> was releasing a full album thanks to an Instagram
post by Mabe Fratti shouting-out the project. The group comprising Mabe and her
close collaborator I. La Cat&#243lica who produced her last solo record released
quite a few abstract art-rock teasers during the leadup to the album, one of
them being <i>Escarbo Dimensiones</i>. It didn't take long for this track to
become my favorite, and how can you <i>not</i> love it when the guitar sounds
so fresh, setting the stage for Mabe to show off on the vocal front.</p>

Benjamin Booker - Slow Dance in a Gay Bar</p>

<p class=firstline>Maybe one of the strongest sad boy anthems of 2025.</p>

<p class=maintext>If there's one thing Benjamin Booker and Kenny Segal did well
on their album <i>Lower</i>, it was conjuring a supreme sense of sadness into a
crop of abstract, hard-to-define tracks that share an overarching gloom. <i>Slow
Dance in a Gay Bar</i> happens to be my favorite example of this phenomenon,
portraying these hopeful ideas of craving a family, or at least some deeper emotional
connection, all while fumbling around in life aimlessly, wasting time in the
process and circling deeper into a state of melancholy that just won't go away.</p>

<p class=firstline>Freaky T on the beat!</p>

<p class=maintext>TiaCorine really did it this year. Her breakout album <i>CORINIAN</i>
painted an exceptional portrait of her colorful and multi-faceted personality,
but I think we can pinpoint her character just as easily on its lead single <i>Backyard</i>.
The track features this punky guitar riff that is imposing and thick, over
which she raps with an amazing nasally flow. Of course, the song is only
improved when JID hops onto the second verse, matching Tia's flow effortlessly while
adding a few quotable bars that match her freak in a playful way. Just a
straight banger that you need to be hearing!</p>

<p class=firstline>I don't even know what the fuck I'm listening to anymore.
This song is bizarre, twisted, strange... It will have you scratching your head
as it hits you with one odd lyric after the next. All in one track, the band covers
<i>OnlyFans</i>, <i>McDonalds'</i> drive-thru lines, AI chatbots, Chandler Bing...</p>

<p class=maintext>Look, weird vibes aside, the song is on this list for a
reason. The way Viagra Boys have built up a prolific career rambling about
oddities over energetic and punky guitars is respectable, and <i>Man Made of
Meat</i> happens to be one of their most direct hits yet. It's this very same
straightforward attitude that made their latest album my favorite from theirs
so far.</p>

<p class=firstline>This track has lots of bite which keeps Rico on the cutting
edge of modern rappers. Compared to many of the other rap songs featured on
this list, this might be the one with the most quotable bars. From lines
referencing Billie Eilish's smash hit <i>Lunch</i> or Travis Scott's <i>Fein</i>,
she demonstrates that her writing can remain contemporary while sticking to
solid principles and fun wordplay. On the instrumental front, that beat switch
that phases into the second half brings such a fiery energy to the booth; it
really makes for one of 2025's most exciting rap cuts.</p>

The Last Dinner Party - Count the Days</p>

<p class=firstline>It's on par with all of The Last Dinner Party's greatest
hits on their debut in 2024. Opening up with one of the most menacing riffs
they've written to date, there's a sinister ambiance underscoring the performance
on <i>Count the Days</i>, all while maintaining the theatrics and drama in a
very natural way. Surprisingly, all this gloom vanishes at the onset of the
chorus which instead presents a much more uplifting and genuine call for
adoration. "I count the ways that I love you every day" might just be one of the
simplest yet most effective lyrics of the year. At the very least, it leads to
such a creative love song with some hidden fangs in the form of somber guitar
tones.</p>

<p class=firstline>Storytelling track of the year? One could definitely make
that argument.</p>

<p class=maintext>On <i>Timezones</i>, Rich Brian recounts a variety of stories
pulled from his childhood, or more specifically during his coming-of-age era.
Detailing <i>Skype</i> calls with friends he's made around the world as a
terminally online kid, it sounds like a proper song that defines a new portrait
for modern youth born in front of screens. I'm also amazed at how he
interleaves so many different aspects of his life on one song, such as his
relationship with his older brother, his first experience being in love with a
girl he met online, that night at the club where he got his first kiss after a
brutal over-text breakup, and even his transition from kid-on-the-Internet to respectable
musician.</p>

<p class=firstline>It's always a good time for a new hit song by The Weeknd. <i>Cry
for Me</i> just so happens to be the song that got popular in the mainstream,
though it's not hard to see why. There's something about the synths in the beat
that make this one of the most accessible tracks on his latest magnum opus,
despite still retaining a somewhat ominous feeling the longer you listen. I
love all the scintillating instrumental elements that get added throughout the
song, and Abel's vocal performance is as impressive as they come. I'm a bit
perplexed as to why we didn't hear more of this album go as viral as this one
song did, but I'm here to remind you that this is just one among many excellent
songs he put out this year!</p>

Natalia Lafourcade - Cancionera</p>

<p class=firstline>Admittedly, the title track to Natalia Lafourcade's latest
album is easily my favorite. There's something so methodical about the way she
sings on <i>Cancionera</i>, it almost feels like she's bringing an entire world
to life using solely her voice and some organic instrumentation. The whole
presentation feels very raw, intimate, and deeply poetic. Perhaps it's not one
of the most inventive songs I've heard in this style, but that doesn't stop it
from being stunning in its simplicity with an appeal that would surely be
enough to sway any new listeners into lending an ear.</p>

intensity in the performances all across this track. Seriously, this is some

Shelly - Cross Your Mind / Hartwell</p>

<p class=firstline>Okay, fine, you caught me: I snuck Clairo onto the list
again!</p>

<p class=maintext>But can you really blame me? I've been addicted to this
doublet by the band Shelly for which she provides part of the vocals. This
doublet makes for such an easy-going indie rock jam, and the two tracks flow so
smoothly into one another. I can't even pick a favorite, which is why both songs
are sharing this spot... And I guess that makes the most sense since I never
really listened to one without the other. It just sounds wrong to split these
sister songs, and it feels even more wrong to think about anyone who hasn't yet
listened to these, especially if you're fond of a lofi spin on your soft rock.</p>

Samia - Bovine Excision</p>

<p class=firstline>The moment I heard <i>Bovine Excision</i> for the first
time, I knew we were in for a phenomenal album cycle. Samia fronts a band that I've
had on my radar for a while, and hearing them evolve their sound into the
nostalgia-based indie rock it turned into nowadays fills me with immense joy...
Or actually, maybe sadness?</p>

<p class=maintext>See, what I actually love about Samia's music is how easily
she toys with melancholy. You can definitely hear some Phoebe Bridgers
influence, though the band is taking things in a new direction with this
single, shifting the focus toward more country-like sounds that emphasize
Samia's powerfully emotional vocal performances. What results is the entry
point into an album that will definitely go down as one of 2025's greatest
hidden gems.</p>

groovy for words, though Freddie has plenty to say as he slides over this
instrumental with such ease; it almost feels criminal for a pairing like this
to work so seamlessly. Add Anderson Paak into the mix to deliver a silky-smooth

real deal for any hip-hop head to enjoy if they're looking for a modern classic.</p>

<p class=firstline>JID just concluded his most commercially successful era yet,
netting him some Grammy nominations in the process. As much as I adored every
aspect of the <i>God Does Like Ugly</i> rollout, I still have one question
left: why didn't this song make the final cut?</p>

<p class=maintext>This song is essentially a leftover, featured only on the
alternate version of the album as a bonus track. Although<i> For Keeps</i> offers
a positive finale where JID reflects on family and his fans in a bright light,
I think <i>Sun</i> more accurately depicts the talent, grit, and darkness that
went into curating this album. From one fantastic verse to the next over a
bare-bones baseline, he lets his true intentions glow, and it is such a gift for
any true fans to witness.</p>

<p class=firstline>Absurd in concept and execution, but what's not to love?</p>

<p class=maintext>Ninajirachi might just be my favorite breakout artist of 2025,
carrying the torch for all EDM lovers to enjoy a modern spin on classic drops
and breakdowns in the genre. <i>Fuck My Computer</i> in particular might just
be her most impressive song: the oddity of singing about wanting to (quite
literally) fuck her computer against the sheer chaos in the electronics makes
this such a strange track. Beyond the surface too, I like how she portrays this
idea of basically having a closer relationship to technology than humanity
without saying much at all; the passion in the music speaks louder than words
on this one.</p>

While <i>Coisas Naturais</i> hits you with one gorgeous song after the next, I
couldn't help but be especially captivated by <i>Lua Cheia's</i> beautiful
synth melody alongside Marina's stunning vocals on the track. Without a doubt,
this is one of the best-written pop songs you'll hear this year, beginning with
a somber acoustic piece that grows into an epic showcase of musical finesse and
a flurry of warm sounds.</p>

backdrop in a lot of moments, but I can't really say the same for its
highlights. Among the many tracks that stood out to me, <i>Mind Loaded</i> is
easily the one I devoted most of my listening time to. It features these
gorgeous vocal leads shared between Caroline Polachek, Mustafa, Lorde, and
Devont&#233 himself, all of which contribute in their own
creative way to this harmony of voices. However, the main selling point is
Devont&#233's own contribution in creating such a sad

<p class=maintext>Chrystia bringing the band into a rock direction was bold,
but I can't think of many stylistic reinventions that panned out as
successfully as this one did this year. <i>Portrait of My Heart</i> is a
gorgeous song with its epic guitar builds, cinematic orchestral allure, and
even the lyrics on the track match the quality of everything you hear in the

I'm pretty sure it's the best opening line to any song in 2025.</p>

<p class=maintext>Hayley Williams is at it again with her solo endeavors, and
this latest era of hers is easily my favorite. Out of all the songs she
released this year, <i>Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party</i> turned out to be
my top pick, though it was a toss up until the very last second. However, I
think it speaks miles that Hayley herself chose this one as the title for the
album: it perfectly encapsulates what makes her such an interesting artist,
displaying her unfiltered and abstract approach to music that clearly separates
her from other modern rock artists both vocally and creatively.</p>

Bad Bunny - Baile Inolvidable</p>

<p class=firstline>Bad Bunny really outdid himself this year. Though I loved
most songs on his latest album, <i>Baile Inolvidable</i> efficiently summarizes
what I admired the most about his approach to music in 2025: don't be afraid to
modernize, but hold home in your heart.</p>

<p class=maintext>The song's theme is perhaps not a new one, depicting Benito
dancing with this woman, calling her the night he won't forget. Though this
idea was probably done before, I think he sells it to us through the
salsa-based instrumental that transports the listener onto the dancefloor. I
can practically visualize the scene every time this song comes on: the lights,
the emotion, the love. Plus, the entire cinematic intro to the song really
pulls you in and makes you feel like you're about to hear something truly life-changing,
maybe even unforgettable.</p>

this was leading up to an album of some sort. After having enjoyed <i>Girl with
Fish</i> so much in 2023, I can only hope that something is still on the way,
even though I'm losing slivers of that hope with every passing day. Regardless,
I still bumped this song all year long, and I'm just astonished at how many
genres they packed into this tiny track without any of it feeling out of place.
Be it punk, electronic, rock, indie pop... It's all present, it's all sounding
great, and it's all making me want to hear more! Maybe 2026 will be the year...</p>

<p class=firstline>Kicking off your album with a song this badass should be a
requirement for all metal albums from now on. Honing in squarely on black metal
for the opening track, Deafheaven return to their roots and sound amazing in
the process. At 6-minutes in length, this song really is a journey that takes
you between this crushing chorus about feeling imprisoned within your own mind,
these intense guitar riffs that relentlessly fight for your attention, a
piercing vocal delivery that the band has become known for, all before slowing
things down at the breakpoint of clarity featuring super tense drums. It's an
instrumental masterclass on what a great metal track should sound like without
sacrificing any of the album's thematic focus.</p>

Sharon Van Etten &amp; The Attachment Theory - Trouble</p>

<p class=firstline>Sharon's vocals are so gorgeous; can we all agree on that?</p>

<p class=maintext>Her voice truly is the common thread stitching together all
of the tracks on this album, and she powerfully sings every lyric such that it
resonates and sticks with you for a long time. Personally, I felt this effect
the strongest on the song <i>Trouble</i>, where she is singing about a
difficult relationship that is bound for failure due to insurmountable personal
differences. It's kind of a heartbreaking little tune about trying to connect

Magdalena Bay - Unoriginal / Black-Eyed Susan Climb</p>

<p class=firstline>Honestly, you could very well use this as a placeholder for
all of the singles (or rather, doublets) that Magdalena Bay dropped this year.
Shout-out to the songs <i>Nice Day</i> and <i>Second Sleep</i>, two others of
my favorites from this uniquely creative era for the duo.</p>

<p class=maintext>For this spot on the list, I placed this particular doublet
because these two tracks handily make for my favorite pair of released tracks. <i>Unoriginal</i>,
despite what the title would lead you to believe, is actually super creative
and quirky, even considering just how outlandish their output has been
recently. One step up from that, <i>Black-Eyed Susan Climb</i> might just be
their most creative and unpredictable track so far. It features a noticeably
country-like groove that had me dancing along, and Mica's vocals fit this style
so well... It has me wondering if they will attempt to modernize country music sometime
in the future. Just imagine how much they could revamp the genre if they really
tried!</p>

Simz - Free</p>

<p class=firstline>Simbi was floating on this beat! Lading on a much more
personal album, it makes sense that this track's topical focus is its main
selling point. Essentially, the song uses verse 1 to explore the way <i>love</i>
infiltrates into one's life, and verse 2 then complements this analysis by
doing the same with <i>fear</i>. Taking these two verses together really works
to contrast the way the two emotions tend to overlap in the closest ways, and I
was really blown away by her lyrical prowess.</p>

<p class=firstline>However, what I love even more is the way the song ends over
these thumping afro-beat grooves with a sample that repeatedly shouts back the
word "free" into the open. What ensues is Simbi using this sample to match the
ending of all her lines with the words "free" or "three" in an interchangeable
and incredibly playful manner. It's hands down one of the best closing sections
to any song this year, and it fills me with a rush of energy each time!</p>

Luna Li &amp; Raveena - Fantasy (Reimagined)</p>

<p class=firstline>Yes, <i>Fantasy</i> came out in 2024, but the reimagined
version is fair game for this list! Besides, how can I in good faith ignore a
track this beautiful? It just feels so wrong, so let me do my thing.</p>

<p class=maintext>In all honesty, if Luna Li is not on your modern pop radar,
you are doing something wrong. Having seen her take the initiative to reimagine
her 2024 album into a more whimsical package was one of my favorite parts of
the year. In particular, adding Raveena onto this song might just be the
smartest musical choice of the year. I mean, the pairing just makes so much
sense, why didn't we think of this sooner? Raveena brings a fairy-dust-like energy
to the song, and the vocal harmonies she contributes are gorgeous. Not to
mention, Luna Li herself tweaked certain production elements (most notably the
bridge) to give the song a more light-hearted tone, and everything is executed
to perfection.</p>

<p class=maintext>Like I said before, I am anticipating great things for the
future if this is the benchmark for what to expect next!</p>

song for this spot might've been a difficult task if <i>Psychoboost</i> didn't

on this track is addicting, cycling through a whirlwind of electronic
soundbites and lightning-fast effects that will have you spinning in an
off-brand club. On top of all of this, Danny Brown comes in and effectively
transforms the track into this rap crossover where he and Jane share verses in
a mind-bending fashion. They have such great chemistry on this song, and I can
just be glad that this collaboration came to exist.</p>

<p class=firstline>Lovely harmonies are at the core of what makes Folk Bitch
Trio such a wonderful music act.</p>

<p class=maintext><i>Cathode Ray</i> is an exceptionally sweet song with an
unwavering sadness woven through its guitars. The way it ramps up from simple
acoustics to a full array of electric guitars and vocal harmonies is
mesmerizing, no matter how many times I give this track a listen. Perhaps its
message and lyrics delve a bit far into abstraction to be fully appreciated by
most, but the girls nailed it for me on this one. As a fan of poetic writing
and sad songs, it's a combination that just works for me, though it truly is

DJ Haram - Voyeur</p>

<p class=firstline>Sneaking into the top 10 is this instrumental track from
none of than underground producer legend, DJ Haram.</p>

<p class=maintext>Now, you might be wondering how a song without vocals made it
in the top 10, which leads me to believe that you've never heard this before.
In fact, you do get 1 word to help understanding what you're hearing: <i>voyeur</i>.</p>

<p class=maintext>If it were up to me to interpret the message behind this
song, I'd say it crudely as follows: we are all voyeurs together, standing back
watching the world getting fucked in front of our very eyes without
intervening. Truth be told, I don't think that's too far off from the intended
meaning.</p>

<p class=maintext>Following from that logic, <i>Voyeur</i> takes on the form of
a call for revolution, ringing like an anthem for large-scale systemic change.
Given the utter chaos in this beat that incorporates blaring horns, thumping /
glitchy drum patterns, and even a great deal of incomprehensible percussions,
it does display the volume and angst preceding any wave of monumental change.</p>

<p class=maintext>Honestly, I'm really impressed that I caught all those
feelings off sound alone, but that's just the power of well-produced music with
a strong driving message.</p>

Wolf Alice - The Sofa</p>

<p class=firstline>Speaking of songs with strong driving messages, how about
you take a seat on this sofa next?</p>

<p class=maintext>In 2025, Wolf Alice came swinging with their new album <i>The
Clearing</i>, presenting a collection of songs each featuring an incredibly
solid central premise or thematic focus. Trust me, picking just one song off
this album was difficult, and I teetered around with all my options until I
decided to opt for <i>The Sofa</i> shortly after beginning the list-writing
process.</p>

<p class=maintext>So, what exactly makes this song so special? At its core,
it's a song about a girl singing about wanting to lay on the sofa and do
nothing... But that's such a shallow overview, way oversimplifying the underlying
message that sums up the album as a whole.</p>

<p class=maintext>See, <i>The Clearing</i> is all about presenting you with
various snapshots of time, whether pleasant, sad, nostalgic, or just plain
passive. It doesn't really matter what the band sings about, but rather <i>what
moment</i> in time they are discussing. On <i>The Sofa</i>, the lyrics seem to
suggest that any emotion in the present is valid, and that one's experiences
can only ever summate to the current moment in time. It doesn't matter if
you're having fun, crying, falling in love, or if you just want to kick back
and lay on the sofa for a little while.</p>

<p class=maintext>In essence, it's a song about being okay with the present and
coming to terms with a linear passage of time that will soon swipe it away.</p>

Geese - Au Pays Du Cocaine</p>

<p class=firstline>Hey, can you play me that one song that keeps making me cry...
Yes, the one about the sailor on a big green boat!</p>

<p class=maintext>Okay but seriously, why is this song so depressing to listen
to? Among a tracklist filled with intense grooves, funky guitar passages, fiery
vocal performances, incredibly persistent drumming, is it really the slow jam
near the midpoint that I put on this list? Yes, and deal with it.</p>

<p class=maintext><i>Au Pays Du Cocaine</i> is a wonderful song because it
doesn't need to make sense for it to resonate with you. Does it matter that
Cameron Winter is singing about craving the life of a sailor on a big green
boat? Does it matter that the second verse is just the lyric "you can change"
repeated about a dozen times? Does it matter that the song title may or may not
have anything to do with the song's content?</p>

<p class=maintext>To those questions, I answer a big, fat, enthusiastic <i>no</i>.
None of these factors matter because, at the end of the day, the song makes me
feel like a very sad boy whenever I put it on, and sometimes the emotional
appeal of a tune is worth a whole lot more than whatever message it's trying to
get across. See, the vocal performance on this song isn't necessarily pretty:
it's gravelly, off-pitch, croaky, odd... But it feels human. I don't know about
you, but I'd rather listen to the Cameron Winter whine and moan his way through
this song with the utmost misery instead of modern rock songs with processed
vocals and artificially-flavored instrumentals.</p>

<p class=maintext>This right here, this is real. It's not pretty, but the band
keeps it real, and I appreciate that.</p>

Horsegirl - In Twos</p>

<p class=firstline>Speaking of songs that make me want to cry...</p>

<p class=maintext>Yes, I'm using that segue again, and I'll use it a third time
if I'm in that mood. Besides, I feel like the reasons I love the Geese track
right before this also apply to this Horsegirl song. My appreciation for these
tracks stems from the same corner of my heart, and the fact that I'm often
feeling like a sad boy definitely helps to bridge the gap between these two
very distinct musical worlds.</p>

<p class=maintext>Again, <i>In Twos</i> is not an exceptionally exciting song
off the band's latest album. In fact, I'd call this the most linear and
monochrome of the bunch, driven by a very simple guitar lick that loops
indefinitely with some dreary vocals layered on top of its simple melody. And
maybe it's this idea of <i>simplicity</i> that I'm trying to emphasize through
these last two picks: songs don't need to reinvent music itself to sound good...
They just need to sound good.</p>

<p class=maintext><i>In Twos</i> is a sad song because it carries what feels
like years of regret after living in a small town. It also sounds like the
result of feeling hopeless for the future, or lost in the present, or sad about
a big change in your life that is about to occur. It sounds like graduating
from school when you just want to stay put, saying goodbye to your friends when
you won't see them for a while, walking along the pier late at night when it's
just a bit too cold.</p>

<p class=maintext>See, this is a song that makes you feel human. It connects
you to yourself by allowing your mind to wander over its simple tune. This is a
song to play whenever you need that little moment of clarity to make it to
tomorrow.</p>

<p class=maintext>Simply put, it's a song that makes me feel alive in a
depressing kind of way.</p>

Model/Actriz - Acid Rain</p>

<p class=firstline>Wow, I'm really going for 3 sad songs in a row. I guess I
was in <i>that</i> kind of mood this year.</p>

<p class=maintext>I mention this later on my album list, but I found myself
enjoying the deep cuts on <i>Pirouette</i> quite a lot more than I did those on
<i>Dogsbody</i>. If anything, I feel like this is an area the band improved
significantly in between albums, and I'm rewarding that improvement with this
placement.</p>

<p class=maintext><i>Acid Rain</i> reads like a tragic fallout between two
lovers, with lyrics having the song's protagonist still reminiscing about this
relationship years later. It comes with a plethora of lyrics that hint toward
this person having been the inspiration behind turning to music as a getaway,
but the band puts it into way more poetic terms than I could ever conjure on my
own. "I sing in part because you often told me that you liked to listen" might
just be the most heart-wrenching lyric I've heard this year. It tears me apart
every time the chorus circles back around, especially on that last iteration
when it's performed acapella in a falsetto.</p>

<p class=maintext>Instrumentally, the song also sees the band performing at
their best, maintaining their typical tension in the drums and guitars, only
this time conducted with a much more dire tone to feed into the drama. I even
love the eerier section near the end which ramps up in typical Model/Actriz
fashion before breaking out into the bare finale I mentioned above.</p>

<p class=maintext>Overall, just a phenomenal love song, definitely one of the
most bittersweet you'll cross in your lifetime.</p>

Deftones - Infinite Source</p>

<p class=firstline>Heading into the top 5, I'll kick things off with the best
song on the new Deftones album: <i>Infinite Source</i>.</p>

<p class=maintext>The concept of the track is relatively straightforward,
pretty much reading like a love letter to being on tour, to the fans, to music
itself more broadly too. It's a great idea, but the execution is truly what
sets this song apart from many others attempting a similar angle.</p>

<p class=maintext>Vocally, Chino still sounds incredible, even on moodier songs
like this one where he's forced to alternate between melodic and
borderline-metal vocal styles. He does a supreme job at matching the energy of
the underlying instrumental, gradually ramping up in intensity as he travels
from the verses to the chorus. Even the bridge is masterful at creating space
for emotion to brew and for his vocals to seep back into a gloomier tone. Instrumentally,
this track is equally as exceptional for all the same reasons.</p>

<p class=maintext>I guess it's a bit difficult to explain what makes this song
so great because it's just so obvious in my mind. Anyone should be able to
enjoy it thanks to its warm guitar tone, lyrics that morph into any meaning you
attribute to them, and impressive vocal deliveries. It's quite simply the whole
package, and I don't think there's too much more for me to add on. As such,
I'll let the music speak for itself instead!</p>

Quadeca - Godstained</p>

<p class=firstline>At number 4, I'm going to give it to Quadeca with the lead
single to his latest album: <i>Godstained</i>.</p>

<p class=maintext>If 2025 showed me anything, it's that lead singles carry a
lot of weight when igniting the album rollout for any artist. Many of the songs
on this list are present because of how well they laid the groundwork for their
respective rollouts, such as Samia's <i>Bovine Excision </i>I mentioned earlier.
I can say this is the case of <i>Godstained</i> too which predicted the path
that <i>Vanisher</i> would take on...</p>

<p class=maintext>That path being unpredictability reincarnated in a musical
format. To me, what makes Quadeca such a unique artist is that he's great at
blending genres together until they sound indistinguishable from one another.
That's what made <i>Scrapyard</i> such a cool mixtape, and it's also what makes
<i>Godstained</i> such an impressive song, sounding like a condensed version of
the experimentation from his previous works packed into a single song.</p>

<p class=maintext>Starting off as a melancholic pop tune with a pleasant vocal melody,
the song quickly transforms into a medley of soft rock, quick-paced rapping,
flute-backed baroque, and all of this is performed with background sounds
emulating the sea. Seriously, the theming of the track (and more broadly of the
album) around water is so creative, and I'm glad Quadeca really stuck with it,
delivering on the concept in a big way.</p>

<p class=maintext>Overall, I think this is very deserving of a spot in the top
10, and I'm still not sick of playing this one almost a year past its initial
release.</p>

Hannah Frances - Falling from and Further</p>

<p class=firstline>With a lead single sounding this warm, I knew I was in for an
incredible album.</p>

<p class=maintext>Listening to <i>Falling from and Further</i> sounds like a
hot sunny day molded into sonic form. That's the best and most accurate way I
can describe this song's sound, and it also extends to a great deal of the
material on this album.</p>

<p class=maintext>Rewinding a bit to add some context, Hannah Frances is an
artist I was introduced to for the first time in 2024 who writes some of the
best contemporary folk songs the modern world has the chance to hear. Last
year, she released <i>Keeper of the Shepherd</i>, a masterfully-written album
concerning themes of loss and regret, all of which was underscored by Hannah's incredibly
raw and powerful vocals.</p>

<p class=maintext>That's probably why this new single surprised me so much.
Contrary to the cold and hostile nature of the last album's sound, this song is
instead wrapped in something so cozy. It shares a very similar drumbeat pattern
to many of the last album's highlights, but it has a distinctly inviting and
positive quality to its horns and upbeat progression. Even thematically, it
writes about being on the other side of grief, having overcome loss and
battling forth for a better tomorrow instead of constantly falling further into
emotional turmoil over circumstances that can't be reverted. And after all the
sad songs listed right below this one, I guess it's a nice change of pace to
showcase some optimism.</p>

<p class=maintext>I could say more, but I'll be speaking about the album as a
whole in greater detail in the next section. Just know that I was incredibly
close to giving Hannah the title of <i>song of the year</i> for a second year
in a row!</p>

Maruja - Saoirse</p>

<p class=firstline>What a phenomenal build!</p>

<p class=maintext>I might not have been clear enough, so let me repeat: what a
phenomenal build on this song!</p>

<p class=maintext>If you've been tapped in with upcoming rock bands, then
Maruja is probably a name you're familiar with. And if this is the first time
hearing about them, buckle up, and get really to hear some life-changing songs.</p>

<p class=maintext>After a string of EPs featuring some intense post-rock tracks
with spoken word vocals detailing stories overtop, the band's style became
cemented with an appeal hovering around the expansive and incremental nature of
their songs. Each song up to now required an impressive build, gradually
climbing up to an explosive finale, and their debut album <i>Power to Pain</i>
follows this formula closely.</p>

<p class=maintext>However, it only took me 2 listens to weed out one track
among the others that felt special. <i>Saoirse</i> initially charmed me thanks
to the beautiful sung melody of its lyric "it's our differences that make us
beautiful" that gets repeated over and over throughout the listen. On impact, I
thought this was such a wonderful message that more people need to hold as true,
and it plays into the album's themes of bridging divides between ostracised and
radicalized societal bubbles. Moving forward, recalling what makes humanity or
societies beautiful requires a recontextualization of this lyric in a way that
benefits all of us.</p>

<p class=maintext>After a few more listens where my aim was primarily to get
familiar with the lyrics, I grew really attached with the way the song builds
tension for about 2 minutes straight before a single word gets uttered. It
makes for a period of silent reflection during which listeners can ponder over
the intensity of the previous song, breathing in before the next
societally-mandated adrenaline spike.</p>

<p class=maintext>It's also worth pointing out just how impressive the vocal
tone is on this track. Every single lyric within the verses is uttered with so
much conviction, I wish more modern rock bands would be as emotionally invested
as Maruja is on this song. I suppose it's this level of passion that drives the
climactic finale with those horns and soaring leads that vanish into a calm
aftermath.</p>

<p class=maintext><i>Phenomenal</i> doesn't really do the song justice. It's a
masterpiece, and easily Maruja's best song yet! </p>

Japanese Breakfast - Honey Water</p>

<p class=firstline>After a lot of consideration about what song should land at this
spot on my list, I finally settled on giving Japanese Breakfast the top spot,
and I have several reasons backing this decision.</p>

<p class=maintext>For starters, picking a Jbrekkie song to add to this list was
a tough enough task to begin with. I had <i>Mega Circuit</i> locked into the
top 10 for the better part of 2025 due to its fun groove, sticky vocal melody,
and great commentary on rejecting and ridiculing toxic masculinity archetypes.</p>

<p class=maintext>Near summertime, I kind of forgot that this album existed as
I gradually made new discoveries, but something pushed it back my way come the
beginning of a new semester. With slightly cooler temperatures and gloomier
days ahead, a great deal of the songs on this album began speaking to me. Some
like <i>Picture Window</i> or <i>Winter in LA</i> depicting a person stuck
inside, not daring to venture in the outside world to discover what life lay
beyond, they really struck me in a new light, especially as I finally began turning
my life around for the better.</p>

<p class=maintext><i>Men in Bars</i> is yet another song that I've only
recently become obsessed with, <i>Orlando in Love</i> features a beautiful
opening message to set the tone for the album, and (really) just about any song
on this album was seeming like a contender for this spot. That's probably why I
ended up putting Jbrekkie on top: anyone writing an album with this many <i>song
of the year</i> contenders should downright deserve the spot.</p>

<p class=maintext>However, what really sealed the deal was when <i>Honey Water</i>
clicked for me. I'm not sure why it took so long to grow on me given that I've
always loved the rockier cuts on older Japanese Breakfast albums, but I
inevitably fell in love with the sound Michelle and the band present on this
song. The appeal for me is immediate because the guitar rhythm that persists
throughout the track kicks off instantaneously. Over this instrumental, she
sings about an unfaithful man, just another toxic relationship that seems to be
clouding her better judgment...</p>

<p class=maintext>Quite literally too. The band goes the extra mile in the
second half of the track to portray this mind fog brought forth by the
relationship, exploding into a fully-fledged shoegaze song with distorted
electric guitars, messy drums, strings that sound like they're coming to you
from all directions, blaring saxophone runs that get progressively louder... It
is such a clusterfuck of noise and chaos, actively depicting a mind filled with
too many thoughts, yet lacking the cohesion to do anything about all the mental
burden. Just hearing the escalation in this track go on for way longer than
you'd anticipate gives me such a thrill, I can't get over just how blissful the
song's climax is!</p>

<p class=maintext>To compliment the song further, <i>Honey Water</i> sounds
like <i>my bloody valentine</i> reincarnated in the year 2025, and that's
pretty high praise coming from someone who considers them to be one of the best
bands to ever do it. Also, I want to point out that Japanese Breakfast have
been putting out exceptional songs like this one for the entire decade. Not too
long ago in 2021, I might have placed <i>Be Sweet</i> at that number 1 spot had
I been making lists back then. I guess that just goes to show that, whether
it's synthpop or shoegaze, some bands just possess a raw talent that can't be
faked.</p>

<p class=maintext>So, yes, I'm confident in this placement... Or maybe my mind's
just been a bit foggy lately, causing me to perceive this song's noise as my
own!</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc217325368">Main Album List</a></h1>

<p class=firstline>Here we go, the moment I've been building up to for all of
2025. Truth be told, this is always the most exciting part of my year, and it's
fascinating for me to look back at these lists several years down the line to
see whether I was right at the time, or whether I'd missed some fairly obvious
picks (I usually skip a couple that turn into dire regrets; re Cameron Winter).</p>

<p class=maintext>I guess there's only one way to find out how my predictions
hold up. It's countdown time!</p>

<p class=firstline>Once again, PinkPantheress returns to deliver a succinct set
of fun bops, and after hearing her 2023 album, I can't say I expected anything
less! At just 20 minutes in length, it proves to be a manageable listen at
pretty much anytime, and I'm glad to hear her still reigning uncontested in the

<p class=firstline>With this presumably being their final album as a duo, <i>Face

<p class=firstline>On his latest release, Skrillex takes things back in a
traditional EDM direction. Not only are the various drops he curated exciting, but
the project's flow also makes this feel more like a live DJ set that you're

<p class=firstline>Maybe this album doesn't reflect the highs of the Canadian
girl-band's breakout album <i>Blame My Ex</i> in 2023, but it still showcases
their ability to put together a damn good batch of tracks that stick to a
consistent theme of queer-drenched heartbreak within sour love ventures.</p>

Marina Satti - Pop Too</p>

<p class=firstline>Using her Greek heritage to breathe new life into modern pop
music, Marina Satti is quickly becoming a pioneer for the genre with every new

<p class=firstline>Despite not being as introspective as 2024's <i>Chromakopia</i>,
introspection is not the intention driving this newest drop from Tyler. In

<p class=firstline>In today's climate, Mariah The Scientist continues to be a

<p class=firstline>A collaboration between organist Kali Malone and experimental

Anna von Hausswolff - Iconoclasts</p>

<p class=firstline>This massively daunting post-rock album nearing 80-minutes

The Last Dinner Party - From the Pyre</p>

<p class=firstline>While The Last Dinner Party doesn't present a tracklist flooded
with snappy bangers like they did on <i>Prelude to Ecstasy</i> in 2024, the
glam rock band still carries over a lot of the initial appeal from their debut
onto their sophomore album. Maybe they stoke the flames of drama a little too
much this time around, but that doesn't discredit just how impressive the
themes, instrumentals, and visuals are all over the record.</p>

<p class=firstline>Brought to you from the same producer behind the genius that

owns its distinct lane of metal, far removed from all other acts thanks to its

<p class=firstline>Under the <i>venturing</i> moniker, Jane Remover explores a
particular strain of slacker rock that reminds me of the best qualities from
bands like Duster and Slowdive who were able to distill melancholy into their
music so effectively. Honestly, this is probably my favorite album of Jane's
yet, both in terms of instrumental consistency and impressive lyrical depth,
without mentioning the genuinely powerful vocal performances added to the mix.</p>

this second helping of Freddie Gibbs rapping over lavish Alchemist beats lives

lyricism and highly dynamic beats keep this album feeling trim and
to-the-point. There's not a dull moment here, and there are many instances of

there's not an ounce of filler on these tracks as they lay out their ideologies

Categorizing her style is inherently difficult because she is constantly
jumping between reggaeton, perreo-pop, synth-based house beats, and pretty much
any instrumental with a high-voltage thump to it. Granted, the sheer act of
attempting a categorization on Miss Lovestory feels more like a detriment to
her artistry which speaks for itself, and she seems to have more than enough personality

a quality album that bridges cultural barriers, acting as a nice entry point

some more time for it to age to perfection.</p>

Die Spitz - Something to Consume</p>

<p class=firstline>Honestly, it's rare for something to click as immediately as
Die Spitz did for me this year. Their appeal is definitely instantaneous; what
you see in their artworks and stylistic depictions truly translate into some of
the most kick-ass music of 2025. Sounding like <i>Nirvana</i> reincarnated on
many of these tracks, the band breathes new life into modern grunge rock, all
while broadening their scope to cover other bases in the realms of metal and
noise rock too. It's intense, amazingly-sequenced, understanding of its own
sonic bubble, and I'm forever indebted to <i>Viagra Boys</i> for putting me on!</p>

<p class=firstline>This album's about as strange as the title would lead you to
believe, but sometimes you need to squint away the message a bit to appreciate
the grander scale of what's being offered. Instrumentally, this album checks
all the boxes for me, delivering a soundscape that borders on prime <i>Cocteau
Twins</i> dreampop and a supremely lush atmosphere that overarches every
moment, resulting in an album that sounds more like an abstract painting with
multiple meanings to be uncovered the longer you stare at it.</p>

<p class=firstline>Yet again, rapper billy woods has resurfaced to grace us
with his abstract poetry and grim outlooks on life. What I specifically loved
about this album is just how terrifying the soundscape is. Having been arranged
by the likes of Kenny Segal, The Alchemist, DJ Haram, Messiah Musik, and many
more faces originating from sphere of legendary underground hip-hop producers,
the combined brilliance of this cast left the album sounding more like a horror
movie, and Mr. woods fills in the gaps with skin-crawling lyricism that is beyond
dark, even by his own standards.</p>

<p class=firstline>After having produced songs for highly influential figures
in the underground like Moor Mother and billy woods, DJ Haram's debut album
shifts the focus on her own excellence and vision. I particularly adore how she
infused typical drum and horn motifs from the Arabic world into her mixes, injecting
a sense of identity and self-appreciation into her music. This is especially
true given just how broad her styles range, from danceable club beats to
revolutionary anthems to ambient instrumentals capturing the dire state of a
crumbling world.</p>

<p class=firstline>On her band's latest album <i>Humanhood</i>, climate activist
Tamara Lindeman makes it a point to dissect humanity and its relationship to
the Earth at its crudest level. In doing so, she delivers a set of reflections
ranging from social isolation to irreversible planetary destruction, each more
interesting than the last thanks to her poetic manner of letting her thoughts
seep naturally through her pen without succumbing to artificial filters nor
eroded clarity. It's a remarkable singer-songwriter project that any fervent
lyricist could get a lot out of hearing.</p>

<p class=maintext>From the moment I heard this album, I was blown away by the
various instrumental styles it presents, all of which sound incredibly detailed
and extremely gripping. Whether she's venturing into drum and bass,
electronic-based pop, punk rock, or even acoustic ballads, she breathes a
distinctly modern sound into these genres. All the while, Julia can be heard professing
ideas of depravity, lust, love, longing, and her somber lyrical arsenal seems
endless as her collection of unsettling images keeps piling higher and higher.</p>

really pushing the idea of <i>genres</i> to its limits with sparkly soundscapes
and a noticeably hazy atmosphere. There's something really special about this
album that's hard for me to describe; it's almost like I still barely know why
I adore it so much. Perhaps it has to do with just how much passion went into
the vocal front to keep things dynamic, or maybe I'm always feeling just woozy
enough to vibrate at the same frequency as the many songs on this project.
Whatever the case, count me in for future releases!</p>

<p class=firstline>As a long-time fan of Twigs' material, I think it's safe to admit
that this is her best-executed era yet. From epic music videos to grandiose
presentations of her vision through extended works (notably <i>Eusexua
Afterglow</i> and the redux edition), everything felt meticulously planned
around a conceptual persona and theme that sound phenomenal when paired
together. Additionally, I love how she infused a retro club theme into many of
the tracks, and even the songs that deviate from this motif to explore more
regional sounds of art pop result in successful tributes to artists having lain
the groundwork way back when.</p>

<p class=firstline>Once again, Aesop Rock continues to operate in a branch of
geeky hip-hop as a lone soldier, always on that same mission to rap about the
most uncanny and unthinkable topics he could muster. Nothing is off limits this
time as he discusses snail infestations, childhood stories about his pet
hamster, and a tale about lending his car to a friend who used it to commit
crimes by a <i>Costco</i>. What makes all of the absurdities pan out
successfully is Aesop's extensive vocabulary which helps to color the space

<p class=firstline>Hands down one of the most impressive Spanish-speaking
albums of 2025. Vocally, Mon Laferte sounds miles ahead of her English-speaking
competitors given just how expressive and modulated her voice is across the
tracklist. Even lyrically, many of these songs are expertly-written, both in
the way they flow from one section to another, but also thematically. This
underlying concept of feeling like a "Femme Fatale" clashes significantly with
her descriptions of longing for something of a normal love / life; it's a
fascinating dynamic to unpack during such a gorgeous listen.</p>

<p class=maintext>After a ferociously groovy and tense debut back in 2023 with <i>Dogsbody</i>,
it's nice to hear the band follow-up with yet another serving of this dance
punk sound that is undeniably their own. While I appreciate the highs like
"Cinderella", "Vespers", or even "Poppy" that stay true to this unique sonic
charm they developed from the get-go, the slow burners are really the ones that
got me this time around. Diving deeper into sexuality, expressivity, and
personal anecdotes, <i>Pirouette</i> feels like an even truer reflection of the
intentions driving the themes and ideas at the core of their creative spirit.</p>

been a while since I heard a group use vocal harmonies and layers to the extent

how bare the instrumental side of the album truly is. Given the minimalistic
approach to the guitars and small bits of percussion, <i>Now Would Be a Good

invited to watch them perform these songs in the comfort of their home during
the initial recording process.</p>

<p class=firstline>Comeback albums have been phenomenal this year, and one of
my favorites has to be <i>Private Music</i> from the legendary rock / metal
band Deftones. Not only is the band sounding fully revitalized over this new
tracklist, but I'd argue that these riffs and melodies go toe-to-toe with their
most classic material. Even from a writing standpoint, there are so many
creative angles they chose to explore, from their love of touring, to genuinely
passionate love songs, circling all the way to anxiety and negative mind spaces
in the process.</p>

<p class=firstline>Saba &amp; No ID work like the perfect pair on this album:
No ID's smooth jazzy production allows Saba to tap into a variety of voices,
attitudes, and styles that let his full artistic profile shine more than it
ever has before. The undeniable sequencing prowess both in terms of the
instrumental choices and lyrical transitions make this a top tier rap album for
me in 2025, and I've relistened to this one in passing several times, often
finding it difficult not to play the whole thing in one sitting after hearing
just the first song.</p>

Haley Heynderickx &amp; Max Garc&#237a Conover - What of our Nature</p>

<p class=firstline>This unlikely duo seems united under one common goal:
exposing and unrooting the filth from the human spirit. However, both artists
work toward this objective in very different fashions: Haley with a poise
tenure and colorful imagery, Max with a rugged bluntness and unapologetic
affect. What I didn't expect going into this album is just how wonderfully
their styles combine when their intentions align, leading to some beautiful
harmonies underscoring one of 2025's most cleverly-written folk albums.</p>

<p class=firstline>I told you this band had potential all the way back in 2023,
I called it!</p>

<p class=maintext>It feels great to be proven right, and <i>Gold Star Baby</i>
wholeheartedly showcases the queer girl-band enacting this potential into a
club-themed album that tackles this sound in a cohesive manner. Despite every
track sharing similar retro pop elements, there's something unique offered by
each song, be it a sick riff, a sticky melody, a standout vocal line, or even a
great lyric or two. In fact, I've had several one-liners and hooks from this
album stuck in my head all year long; it's that catchy!</p>

<p class=maintext>Thematically too, I'm impressed at just how well they were
able to expand this formula of breakup / love albums with new ideas. The song
"Stroke" about being overcome by an ego trip or centering the album around the
"Gold Star Baby" club... Everything sounds so smart and well executed. Definitely
one of the best pop albums to write about in 2025!</p>

<p class=maintext>What the trio of girls achieved here is remarkable. <i>Phonetics
On And On</i> sounds like a piece of lost memorabilia in the smallest town
barely known to exist. In a strange way, listening to this album is somewhat
like staring in the face of the past, wondering how to move on to the future, all
while sulking in a present moment that feels too long for comfort. It's
awkward, it's both fun and sad, but it's most certainly musically stellar, and
the cute melodic quirks make it obvious that creating a compelling tune was at
the heart of every song on the album.</p>

<p class=maintext>Without a doubt, <i>Lethal</i> features some of the hardest
bars you'll hear this year, with many of Rico's punchlines hitting harder than
they've ever hit before. With a ferocious demeanor, she expands her typical
trap sound to incorporate punkier guitars, metal-like breakdowns, and some
touching acoustic ballads that cutely wrap up the album. However, to my ears,
it's the album's quick-paced and unflinching flow that makes it such a smooth

heavily refined tracklist, polished song structures, and catchy choruses. In
2025, Geese ditched this formula entirely for something loose, unpredictable,
and absolutely insane!</p>

<p class=maintext><i>Getting Killed</i> sounds about as ludicrous as its title
lets on. With Cameron Winter's pen remaining as unhinged as it was on his solo
effort <i>Heavy Metal</i> from 2024, the band sings about pretty much anything
you could imagine over intense percussions, delirious grooves, and downright
funky rock tunes. You don't even have to try to make sense of these lyrics
(trust me, deciphering the undecipherable is not worth the headache), but these
songs will still undoubtedly have you feeling thrilled and also crushed in the
unlikeliest moments. Surely, this is one of the strangest rock albums I've

in the near future, that is, if it isn't a classic already!</p>

comebacks, and the band is picking at the roots of their golden era to
reconstruct what made their spin on electronic music so appealing to begin
with. Perhaps it's the unwavering positivity linked to this type of sound, or
maybe it's just my personal bias toward bubbly instrumental cuts, but I adored

<p class=firstline>Simply put, this album has me in awe. It's just that simple.</p>

<p class=maintext>See, it's been a while since I heard an album like <i>The
Clearing</i> where every song sounds intentional, covering its own mini theme
or story succinctly and effectively. "Just Two Girls" deals with the topic of
friendship, "Leaning Against The Wall" describes a scene at a party where
you're kind of hoping to be noticed by someone, "Passenger Seat" paints this
picture of being swooned by the driver when stuck in the passenger seat... I can
go on and on!</p>

<p class=maintext>Also, it's one thing to come up with all these incredible
song concepts, but it's another thing to actually back up each of these
scenarios with instrumentals equally rich and varied from one track to the
next. The musical brilliance of this record excels in taking you from one scene
to the next without ever questioning what you're hearing, and the climactic
closing track "The Sofa" truly ties things together into a finish that just
makes me want to run it all back anew.</p>

<p class=maintext>Without question, Ghais Guevera is holding up the underground
rap scene with an album that went criminally overlooked this year. <i>Goyard
Ibn Said </i>presents a phenomenal concept where its titular character is found
stricken by fame, forced to perform on stage before an audience seeking nothing
more than to devour him whole. Faced with these absurd expectations, Goyard
initially indulges in luxury raps before his true opinions about systemic
oppression and insurmountable social barriers begin slipping through the

only one person to tell. Conceptually, it is inarguably her most mature batch
of tracks dealing in love and family in the most concrete light so far.</p>

<p class=firstline>There's something particularly sinister about hearing
someone being so brutally honest about the state of the world at large, but who
better to do so than Backxwash herself?</p>

<p class=maintext>Yet, her honesty spans further than the atrocities looming
above us at all times of day: she spends a great deal of this album dismantling
her own figure, exposing her own mental struggles, going as far as to label
herself as <i>gross</i> and <i>undesirable</i>. It's a tormented listen that is
matched in intensity by the experimental production laying the grounds for her
anger-tinged delivery.</p>

<p class=maintext>Still, despite concluding that only dust will remain at the
end of every tragedy in this life, the glossy instrumentation and bright

<p class=maintext>Marina Sena is an artist I absolutely fell in love with this
year, not just because she's charismatic and stunning, but also because her
music has such a charming allure to it. Coming to you straight from Brazil, <i>Coisas
Naturais</i> is an album that blends traditional Latin pop, a bit of reggaeton,
synthpop, and a whole lot of contemporary pop featuring a great deal of unique
experimental sounds.</p>

<p class=maintext>On top of just how pretty the whole package is wrapped in, its
writing is simply incredible. The way Marina interleaves nature-based imagery
into her experiences treading with love is just so impressive. She basically
weaves through emotional complexity unlike any other artist has this year, and

JID - God Does Like Ugly</p>

<p class=firstline>I'm telling you, JID simply cannot miss! He's one of my
GOATs for a reason!</p>

<p class=maintext>After releasing what I still hold to be the decade's
strongest hip-hop album in 2022 with <i>The Forever Story</i>, my hopes for JID
matching that level of quality were very dismal. And yet, despite my initially
low expectations, I feel bad that I ever doubted him.</p>

<p class=maintext>Maybe <i>God Does Like Ugly</i> isn't the flawless
masterpiece that JID's last release was; it's nonetheless a conceptual
reiteration of what makes him such a fantastic rapper. On the search of what
makes one <i>ugly</i>, he takes us on a journey into his mind, through the
depths of Hell and back in the process. Not to mention, he never falters even
slightly on the performance side, offering one electric flow after the next,
surgically weaving through slick bars with ease.</p>

<p class=maintext>And on top of all this, he's expanding his musical side as
well, operating over novel kinds of beats that have no business working so well
in tandem with his quick-paced deliveries. It truly is an inspirational album, landing
just shy of my top 10 this year!</p>

alt="A map of the ocean&#10;&#10;AI-generated content may be incorrect.">10. Quadeca
- Vanisher, Horizon Scraper </p>

<p class=firstline>Kicking off the top 10, Mr. Quadeca himself came through
with what I consider to be his masterpiece.</p>

<p class=maintext>I was already a pretty big fan of 2024's <i>Scrapyard</i>,
but <i>Vanisher</i> takes Quadeca's artistry to a whole new level. From the
cinematic backdrop provided by the full-length film accompanying the album, it
really sounds like undertaking an entire journey when listened to in full.</p>

<p class=maintext>One feature I absolutely adore about this album is the
consistent theming of the tracks with a bunch of ocean- / water-based elements.
From waves rustling through the tracks to lyrics about a nautical voyage, it
sounds like the most compelling exploration of a concept that I've heard in
2025. I especially love how this motif is maintained up until the end when you
can pretty much hear the protagonist getting invaded by the waters, essentially
drowning after undergoing such a long and perilous quest.</p>

<p class=maintext>Theming aside, the musicality underscoring the project is
just as impressive to me. Something Quadeca did incredibly well on <i>Scrapyard</i>
was exploring various genres within a loose framework. After having tested
these styles last year, it really sounds like he took the best of these
explorations and composed genre-bending combinations on tracks like
"Godstained" which are almost impossible to define stylistically. Even on the
vocal front, Quadeca delivers one stunning performance after the next,
absolutely nailing the slower tracks like "Monday" or even the gigantic
"Forgone".</p>

<p class=maintext>It's just a special album, and I can definitely get behind
the Quadeca hype at this point.</p>

Ninajirachi - I Love My Computer</p>

<p class=firstline>I sure do love girl EDM!</p>

<p class=maintext>There are few albums in 2025 that managed to strike a balance
between being fun, accessible, and conceptual in the way that Ninajirachi
achieved on her debut. I mean, let that sink in: this is her <i>first</i>
album, and it's already beyond fantastic. Imagine how great things have the
potential to be!</p>

<p class=maintext><i>I Love My Computer</i> is obviously an ode to Nina's love
for all things electronic. From the cover art depicting her surrounded in her
room by a mess of cables and hardware to her flagrant professions of wanting to
fuck her computer, this is an incredibly aptly-themed project. Not to mention
that the sound echoes a lot of what is being portrayed lyrically via these
booming EDM drops and rave-like ambiances shredding open some of the most
upbeat songs of the year. I know I mentioned this before, but the inner EDM
child locked within my spirit kept me coming back time and time again to enjoy
the melodies and beat progressions!</p>

<p class=maintext>Stepping away from the instrumentals for a second, I also
want to appreciate just how personable Nina gets from a writing standpoint. She
really takes you through her childhood using snapshots of past eras, and as I
kid who once owned an iPod touch with a yellow <i>Pikachu</i> case, I can
confidently say this is the lyric I related to the most in 2025. And again,
being a woman making EDM seems to be a crucial component of her persona as she
takes the listener through her innermost thoughts regarding growing up as a
girl in a male-dominated musical universe.</p>

<p class=maintext>Honestly, I'm blown away by how hard hitting the beats are on
this thing, and the touching singing performances and lyrical gems help bolster
this toward a top 10 placement. I wouldn't have it any other way.</p>

Danny Brown - Stardust</p>

<p class=firstline>I predicted this album's existence 2 years ago, and I was so
right about it being as good as it turned out!</p>

<p class=maintext>To understand why this album means so much to me, I think
it's worth rewinding back to late 2023 / early 2024. See, the post-<i>Quaranta</i>
era of Danny's career marks a notable shift in sonic direction. Despite loving
that album at the time it released, I will admit that I've only sparsely gone
back to it since then, and I assume that has to do with just how familiar the
sound of it rings nowadays.</p>

<p class=maintext>In 2024, Danny went on a run of fantastic features with
notable collaborators such as Frost Children, Alice Longyu Gao, Femtanyl, and
many more, all of which were feeding into my desire to see him drop a project
fully diving into these electronic and hyperpop aesthetics that I've really
been loving in modern pop music. My anticipation reached a peak when I heard
him praising the latest underscores album <i>Wallsocket</i> (which I still love
and play more often than not), and I knew it was all a matter of time until my
dreams materialized.</p>

<p class=maintext>Sure enough, I had to wait for late 2025, but I would've
waited even longer for this album if needed. After hearing this, I have to say:
I'm pretty sure Danny Brown is more tapped in than I am when it comes to
contemporary talent. Not only does <i>Stardust</i> feature some of my all-time
favorite artists like Quadeca, underscores, and Jane Remover, but he is also
putting me onto some new faces in the process: Issbrokie has a killer verse on
her track, Holly produced some of the wildest sounding beats I've heard in
2025, and taUkrainka adds some Ukrainian / Polish verses that absolutely steal
the show by the album's end.</p>

<p class=maintext>To keep it short before I ramble on any longer, I think Danny
Brown found his calling with this rap-pop-electronic hybrid. Not only does he
keep his lyrics precise and profound, but he's also doing so in a way that
doesn't compromise on sonic creativity, and not many rappers are operating with
as much flair and free-wheeling spirit as he's been showcasing lately.</p>

src="Albums/CLIPSE - LET GOD SORT EM OUT.jpg" align=left hspace=12
alt="A skeleton with hands and hands&#10;&#10;AI-generated content may be incorrect."></p>

<p class=firstline>Without a doubt one of the best rap albums of 2025.</p>

<p class=maintext>On <i>LGSEO</i>, Clipse make a ferocious comeback, reclaiming
their throne at the top in a way that's quite uncommon for new-age artists to
do. With a stellar rollout (both before and after dropping the album), the duo
managed to breathe life back into hip-hop while reminding audiences around the
world what made their initial run so incredible.</p>

<p class=maintext>First, the bars are top notch. On any of the album's songs, I
feel like you can pull out 3-5 quotables, which is almost unheard of in today's
age. Both Pusha T and Malice find ways to say a lot through seemingly
inoffensive lines, and I truly love the way they stick to rhyming patterns for
each individual song. It really feels like a resurgence of vintage rap in that
regard.</p>

<p class=maintext>Second, the production is top notch. Manned mainly by Pharrel
Williams, every song sounds absolutely pristine: he manages to capture sinister
ambiances, to experiment with novel ideas, and to throw it back to some of the
earliest works by the <i>Neptunes</i>. Across the entire album, there's not
even a single beat I can call out as being weak: every moment counts, every
drum hit feels needed, and I have absolutely no complaints.</p>

<p class=maintext>Third, the features are top notch. Whether it's Kendrick
Lamar on "Chains &amp; Whips", Tyler the Creator on "P.O.V" (still love the way
he says peel off like an orange), or even that tremendous chorus by Stove God
Cooks on "F.I.C.O", Clipse had a vision when it came to selecting a roster for
the album, and every person they invited delivered in a big way. Even more
minor inclusions like the spoken word passages by Stevie Wonder and The Dream
felt necessary to the full listen, and I again have no notes.</p>

<p class=maintext>If anything, this album is a testament to the talent and
motivation required to make a rap album worthy of the <i>album of the year</i>
title. And Clipse proved to have both in spades this year.</p>

alt="A couple of people carrying clouds on their heads&#10;&#10;AI-generated content may be incorrect.">6.
De La Soul - Cabin in the Sky</p>

<p class=firstline>Truly one for the soul.</p>

<p class=maintext>Indeed, my favorite rap album of the year comes from a
defining hip-hop trio from the 80's and 90's, once again solidifying that 2025
was a year marked by impressive comeback albums from unlikely repeat faces.</p>

<p class=maintext>Interestingly, I assumed we'd never get another De La Soul
album ever again, especially not after Dave, one of the band's founding
members, tragically passed away in 2023. But this would've been a shame, and the
remaining duo wanted to ensure that Dave's legacy lived on in the current era.
And what better way to introduce a new set of faces to some of hip-hop's most
classic works than to release a masterclass unlike any other.</p>

<p class=maintext><i>Cabin in the Sky</i> is an album, but it's more
importantly a metaphor best exemplified by the cover art. With Pos and Maseo
carrying on the trio's legacy, they spend this album conjuring a metaphorical
"cabin in the sky" where Dave is now peacefully residing in the afterlife.
Narrated by Giancarlo Esposito, the album kicks off with an introduction of the
many legacy artists that contributed to this album's success, including some
all-time rapping legends like Killer Mike, Black Thought, Nas, Slick Rick,
Common, Q-Tip... The list goes on, and the role-call segment is a brilliant way
to introduce this concept.</p>

<p class=maintext>Of course, any good album is only as great as the music
behind the message, but De La Soul ensures that even those bases are covered by
the time the first official song begins. Immediately, you get hit with their
signature boom-bap style which punches you right in the nostalgia muscle, and
some legendary producers like DJ Premier, Pete Rock, and even Dave himself
contribute to making this album sound old-school but still fresh by today's
standards. There are so many standout beats, it's impossible to list them all,
but some of my favorites include the dance sample on "Cruel Summers Bring Fire
Life", the shimmering production that makes "Yours" sound like a ray of
sunshine, and the jazzy spin on "En Eff" which is pure bliss for vintage
hip-hop heads.</p>

<p class=maintext>As a post-humous album, I think the premise of a "cabin in
the sky" wonderfully embodies this idea of the afterlife, and De La Soul builds
up this concept so well; it really does sound like Pos and Maseo are reaching
out to Dave from beyond on many of the deep cuts. And I guarantee, hearing that
last song will have you in tears once you put all the pieces together.</p>

<p class=maintext>RIP Dave, you'll live on through this album, forever.</p>

src="Albums/SAYA GRAY - SAYA.jpg" align=left hspace=12
alt="A person with a metal eye&#10;&#10;AI-generated content may be incorrect."></p>

<p class=firstline>Art pop is such a good genre, isn't it?</p>

<p class=maintext>I'm a known sucker for art pop albums. I've always loved how artists
like Kate Bush or Julia Holter are able to mold sound into such interesting
ways, turning could-be-radio-hits into far off abstractions that are just
strange enough to dodge the mainstream.</p>

<p class=maintext>Personally, I think Canadian-Japanese artist Saya Gray
handily claims art pop victory with her self-titled debut album in 2025. Even
all the way back in February when this released, I remember being immediately
fully immersed into the listen the minute I heard the transition between tracks
3 and 4. From that moment onward, it's just been pure admiration on my behalf
as I worked to unpack the many faces concealed behind such a mysterious figure.</p>

<p class=maintext>What's interesting is that Saya previously released some <i>QWERTY</i>
EPs before making this album and, although they were a lot messier and
difficult to envision as whole, they laid the groundwork for the unique
instrumentation that can be heard all over <i>SAYA</i>. She truly carried over
the smoothest ideas and maintained a lot of the same lyrical motifs that give
her catalogue a common thread between projects.</p>

<p class=maintext>On the instrumental side, there's a lot of variety for such a
compact listen. I love the twangy guitars that make the 2 opening tracks so
groovy, I love the masterful drumbeats near the albums midpoint that help to
link the tracks in a way that feels so organic, I love the bits of harp
scattered everywhere that offer a magical quality to the sound, I love the
electric guitar explosions at the end of "Exhaust the Topic" that give me a
rush of energy every time; I pretty much adore every single musical idea she
throws your way across the listen.</p>

<p class=maintext>If I had to pick a favorite component to the album though,
I'd definitely say its lyricism. Despite mainly dancing around the topic of
love as many artists have done for centuries now, Saya uses such creative
imagery to rehash ideas that have been around forever. Whether envisioning a
graveyard in her dreams where her love went to die or picturing herself melting
as a puddle at her lover's feet, there are so many evocative visuals laced in
the tracklist. She also tells a very compelling story from start to finish,
ingeniously circling back to this line about "not springing for love" before
the album reaches its conclusion.</p>

<p class=maintext>Hey, give it a try! It won't let you down, I promise.</p>

src="Albums/HANNAH FRANCES - NESTED IN TANGLES.jpg" align=left hspace=12></p>

<p class=firstline>As far as albums that have had a huge impact on my life in
2025, <i>Nested in Tangles</i> ranks amongst the top contenders (if not the
top).</p>

<p class=maintext>My appreciation for Hannah's music stems from her 2024
release <i>Keeper of the Shepherd</i>, an album that redefined my love for folk
music and profound lyrical displays. Looking back at my top albums list from
last year, I definitely feel like I might've lowballed this ranking a bit given
just how frequently I've revisited her songs this year, especially in the
lead-up to this new album.</p>

<p class=maintext>Essentially, just a year later, we're graced with more of the
same, though this time there is a noticeably warmer and more optimistic angle
surrounding the album's theming. Despite a lot of the subject matter still
ringing as emotional as can be, songs like "Falling from and Further" sound way
more positive than the hollowed-out desperation from many of <i>Keeper's</i> most
cathartic moments. </p>

<p class=maintext>It also helps that the instrumentals carry many of the
qualities I admired from her 2024 work, adding a warmer charm with guitarwork
from Daniel Rossen on 2 major songs this time around. Even the flow from track
to track feels more dynamic thanks to the added interludes that help to seal
the experience nicely. You can definitely expect the usual sunny guitar tones,
progressive drum patterns, saxophone runs that'll leave you wanting more, and
even some electric guitars mixed with panning vocal effects that really show
how creatively she was operating this year.</p>

<p class=maintext>Hannah's lyricism is also commendable, and she carries the
bulk of this project through sheer vocal talent and contemplative writing. A
ballad like "Steady In The Hand" rings as one of the most tender songs I've
heard in 2025 (and of all time), the heightened energy on "Surviving You" feels
as dramatic as the lyrics imply, and I love the grandiose instrumental build on
"Heavy Light" that resolves the album at the brightest sonic peak you can
imagine.</p>

<p class=maintext>I suppose seeing her perform many of these songs live really
brought the album to life for me, and I can't pretend like I'm not hopelessly
enamoured by her artistic prowess after hearing just two albums!</p>

<p class=album>3. Deafheaven - Lonely People with Power<img width=97 height=97 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"
src="Albums/DEAFHEAVEN - LONELY PEOPLE WITH POWER.jpg" align=left hspace=12></p>

<p class=firstline>Yes. Yes! YES!!!</p>

<p class=maintext>Okay, I might get some flack for this, but I'm going to say
it anyway: I never really saw <i>Sunbather</i> as a decade-defining metal album
during the 2010's. Don't hate me, but it's true. I could definitely commend the
experimentation that Deafheaven underwent when recording an album merging black
metal and shoegaze, but it's not an album I used to replay all that much. I've
always admired it, but part of me always wondered whether the band could put
together an even more interesting take on blackgaze...</p>

<p class=maintext><i>Lonely People with Power</i> answers the question about
just how good things could get: really fucking good! I might get flack for this
next statement too, but I'll be brave: this is hands-down Deafheaven's best
album, and it's not even close.</p>

<p class=maintext>It's been a while since I heard a metal album where the
lyrics act as the primary appeal to me. However, the band undeniably wrote some
hits, and I deeply encourage you to devote all your attention to this record when
giving it a spin to actually dive into what's being said. The cover art alone
is already striking enough of a visual, but they get even more precise with
every lyric discussing ideas of psychosis, declining mental health, crippling
loneliness, desires of warmth or intimacy, unbreakable gender roles and
expectations, insurmountable addiction, repeated cycles of depravity, and the
album ends things ambiguously with the protagonist embarking on this road
toward recovery, though the listener is left wondering whether change is truly
on the horizon.</p>

<p class=maintext>So, yeah, the album is incredibly gripping thematically, but
the tunes at the core of the music are just as entertaining as the message. The
song "Doberman" kicks things off with a bang, showcasing just how strong the
band is when they stick to pure black metal: the track's chorus is phenomenal,
I love the phasic shifts in energy, and it's just an exceptional banger. These
fiery guitar tones carry over on many tracks like the climactic ending to
"Magnolia" and even the main riff driving "Amethyst" toward such a glorious
midpoint.</p>

<p class=maintext>It's also interesting to hear the band experiment with
various styles of music beyond simply sticking to their comfort zone of
piercing black metal. "Heathen" features a soft melodic passage that opens up
the song, and I'll be the first to admit that the combination between simple
acoustic and crushing metal right after just works. This style blend is also
reiterated during the multiple spoken word segments that help keep the tension
between the album's many moments, and I love how unpredictably some songs will
just fade to utter silence without a warning. Finally, it was nice to hear them
devote the last two tracks to a more typical blackgaze experience which really
helps to lull you into a state of semi-consciousness as you come to terms with
the beauty of what you just heard. Really, it's such a powerful finale, and a
subtly emotional one too.</p>

<p class=maintext>All in all, I can't really throw this album any further
praise beyond the obvious: metal album of the year!</p>

<p class=album>2. The Weeknd - Hurry Up Tomorrow<img width=97 height=97 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"
src="Albums/THE WEEKND - HURRY UP TOMORROW.jpg" align=left hspace=12
alt="A person with curly hair and a sad face&#10;&#10;AI-generated content may be incorrect."></p>

<p class=firstline>Pure cinema.</p>

<p class=maintext>I'll be the first to admit that I was slightly worried going
into this album when I heard the singles leading up to it, but all of those
worries melted away instantly when "Wake Me Up" transitioned into "Cry for Me"
so jarringly on that first listen.</p>

<p class=maintext>What Abel Tesfaye achieved on <i>Hurry Up Tomorrow</i> is
exceptional. This is the 3<sup>rd</sup> and last installment in this latest
trilogy of albums he put out in the 2020's, and I can't say that he faltered
even once during the whole process. From redefining synthpop in a new era with <i>After
Hours</i> to conceptualizing an entire purgatory radio-state on <i>Dawn FM</i>,
there's nothing Abel can't do.</p>

<p class=maintext>On this final leg of the trilogy, the emphasis seems to be conducting
a cinematic finish to the saga, and Abel succeeds with flying colors thanks to
the legendary cast of producers he assembled to assist in making <i>Hurry Up
Tomorrow</i> sound so polished: Justice kills it on "Wake Me Up" as they flip
that classic guitar groove on "Thriller" into something new, Max Martin on
"Open Hearts" leads the track to a place of pop perfection, Metro Boomin and
Travis Scott help bridge the gap between classic and modern soundscapes,
Giorgio Moroder even makes an appearance on "Big Sleep" to drive home the
dramatic turning point with a heavy dose of shimmering synths, but you get the
idea by now.</p>

<p class=maintext>Not only did Abel recruit some of the best producers in the
game, but he also curated a feature list precisely to bring to light his vision
of the end. Everyone contributes to this album in a positive way: Anitta
carries the funky ambiance on "S&#227o Paulo" to a new dimension, Travis Scott on
"Reflections Laughing" plays the role of Abel's darkest side with a low pitch
delivery whereas Florence + The Machine adds some divine backing vocals in the
leadup to the darkness, Future on "Enjoy The Show" absolutely smashes his
emotional verse, Lana Del Rey stuns on "The Abyss" with her vocal range, and
even Playboi Carti on "Timeless" gives his best performance in years!</p>

<p class=maintext>However, on an album 80-minutes in length, it's safe to say
that Abel himself takes up the bulk of the runtime, and he does not disappoint
even slightly. Throughout the listen, he offers some of his personal writing
ever, he gives you one stunning vocal performance after the next, he carries
you seamlessly from track to track thanks to genius musical ideas and a
plethora of short segues, and it's just an impressive foray into the most
creative corners of his mind.</p>

<p class=maintext>I'm a bit perplexed that this album was a bit sidelined by
the public, but don't be fooled by the shy reception: giving this album your
time will only feel rewarding in the end. As a long-time fan of <i>The Weeknd</i>
as a musical persona, I couldn't imagine a better finale to the infamous
character's legacy.</p>

<p class=album>1. Samia - Bloodless<img width=97 height=97 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)"
src="Albums/SAMIA - BLOODLESS.jpg" align=left hspace=12
alt="A person in a garment&#10;&#10;AI-generated content may be incorrect."></p>

<p class=firstline>I debated for a long time before opting to put this at the
number one spot, but it feels right the more I look back at this ranking.</p>

<p class=maintext>In a year where I spent a great deal of time confronting
novelty, having something constant to act as a baseline to my life felt
comforting. Somehow, the stars aligned in a way that Samia became that
reference point for me in 2025.</p>

<p class=maintext>I discovered Samia in 2023 when she put out her album <i>Honey</i>,
and I remembered really clicking with that record's sadness at the time.
Shortly after, I dug my way back to 2020's <i>The Baby</i>, and I liked the
poppier elements of that album even more than the dreariness of its successor.
Naturally, having been primed on her career before the leadup to <i>Bloodless</i>
back in January, I was thrilled to be entering a new era blindly.</p>

<p class=maintext>However, I knew we'd be hearing something special the moment
"Bovine Excision" released as the lead single. On top of highlighting the
natural country appeal to Samia's voice in a way that hadn't been taken
advantage of previously, it features this really cryptic and abstract lyricism
which forms the bulk of what makes <i>Bloodless</i> so appealing to me. The
track sets this central theme about being drained, sucked dry, and completely
empty inside, and Samia runs with this idea throughout the remainder of the tracklist
with ease.</p>

<p class=maintext>As singles kept steadily releasing during the beginning of
the year, I found myself increasingly anticipating the full album. "Lizard" was
another track which marked me thanks to its sparkly guitar tone, "Hole in a
Frame" hit me hard due to its nature being infused with several potent doses of
melancholy, and dropping the 6-minute closing track "Pants" as a single might
be the boldest musical move of the year. It's definitely not an accessible
track with its lack of structure, odd breakpoint build, and phasic nature, but
it had me so intrigued to hear more; I was on the edge of my seat waiting for
the release date to come strolling by.</p>

<p class=maintext>When that day finally came, I sat down and listened, only for
all my anticipation to feel validated on the spot. Perhaps <i>Bloodless</i>
isn't the most ambitious nor technically proficient album I've ever heard, but
it's rare to come across gems like these where every song feels special. I can
even go as far as saying that the great deal of songs on this album very well
had the potential to be singles. Take "Dare" with its low-pitched groove and
slow jam nature that displays Samia's vocal talent tremendously as she carries
the weight of emotion so well through every lyric. You can also take "North
Poles" with its fascinating build as it effortlessly weaves between choruses, sort
of acting like a beacon of light amidst a listen that hovers around gloom most
of the time. I even love the small interlude-like moments such as "Craziest
Person" which help unify the album as a whole.</p>

<p class=maintext>And yes, something that would be criminal for me to neglect
is just how seamlessly each track glides into the next. Sometimes the
transitions come across as abrupt and jarring, but the underlying rhythm that
the tracks carry just makes perfect sense in the context of a full listen. Suddenly,
hearing "Pants" again after acquiring this newfound context elevates it to a
new height, and I was right to be intrigued about it initially.</p>

<p class=maintext>I guess I can end things off by complimenting Samia's
lyricism, vocal talent, but also the way her and the band she works with sound
completely in sync the entire time. Instrumentally, everyone is playing as a
unit, and that offers a lot of charm to the listen. I'm a big fan of music that
sounds like it was made in a fun condition because it more often than not
translates into the quality of the record.</p>

<p class=maintext>All I'm saying is that I'm truly in awe at how wonderfully
Bloodless turned out, and it's my most played album of the year for a reason.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p class=firstline>With that, I suppose it's time for me to wrap up 2025 and
lift my head up for the new year.</p>

<p class=maintext>I'm not exactly sure what to expect next, but I like to end
my years feeling optimistic for the future. At this time last year, I was
undeniably going through a rough patch with a lack of perspective, but I feel
like I'm in a better place as I write this closing blurb today. Maybe it's too
soon to tell, or maybe it's no... I'm still feeling good as I look on toward
2026 for some sense of resolve to wash over me.</p>

<p class=maintext>Maybe that's a bit overkill, I'll think about it. Whatever
the case, if you made it all the way to the bottom, thanks for checking out my
lists. Even if you don't grab any recommendations from my picks, the very fact
that you made it here (even if you just scrolled to the bottom) means that you
cared enough to click you way here. For that, thank you. Listening to music is
a huge part of my life, and it's something I love to share with anyone I meet.
As such, I'll keep going, forever.</p>

<p class=maintext>Cheers to the new year. See you then.</p>
