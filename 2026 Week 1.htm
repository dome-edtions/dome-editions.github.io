<h1>Anticipated Releases for 2026</h1>

<p class=firstline>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Week 1 of 2026: Music Recap</h2>

<p class=firstline>With 2025 now in the rearview, it&#8242;s time to look
forward to 2026!</p>

<p class=maintext>Now seems like a better time than any to try to predict what
to expect from this upcoming new year, at least, music-wise. With many artists
beginning album rollouts near the end of 2025, I&#8242;d love to shout-out some
upcoming releases I&#8242;m the most excited to hear in the coming months.
Aside from that, I also want to make some predictions as to which artists will
make comebacks this year, however unlikely they may seem.</p>

<p class=maintext>Look, the premise is simple enough, so here is my list.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=95 height=95 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)" style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)" 
	src="Albums/A$AP ROCKY - DON'T BE DUMB.jpg"
align=left hspace=12
alt="A cover of a album&#10;&#10;AI-generated content may be incorrect.">A$AP
Rocky - Don&#8242;t Be Dumb</p>

<p class=firstline>We are long overdue for some new A$AP Rocky music.</p>

<p class=maintext>This time, it seems as though this release might be for real.
With several album cover arts being revealed by Rocky himself (all of which were
designed by Tim Burton), it&#8242;s seeming more like a close reality than a
distant fantasy I&#8242;d often dreamed of.</p>

<p class=maintext>The question remains: what will this album even sound like?
Back in 2024, Rocky released 2 of my favorite hip-hop songs from that year,
those being <b><i>Highjack</i></b> and <b><i>Tailor Swif</i></b>. They had this
very vintage sound to them, kind of mimicking the early 2010s mixtape era Rocky
emerged from initially. Still, it&#8242;s hard to know whether this album will
actually sound like these singles, or better yet, whether these songs will even
land on the final tracklist.</p>

<p class=maintext>Who&#8242;s to say for sure? For all we know, this might just
be another elaborate stunt that will never materialize. Fingers crossed that&#8242;s
not the case.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=95 height=95 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)" 
	src="Singles/SARAH KINSLEY - FLEETING.jpg"
align=left hspace=12
alt="A cover of a album&#10;&#10;AI-generated content may be incorrect.">Sarah
Kinsley</p>

<p class=firstline>Back in September 2025, Sarah Kinsley released the lead
single <b><i>Fleeting</i></b> to her next album. Though I&#8242;d enjoyed some
of the key songs from her 2024 debut album <b><i>Escaper</i></b>, none of them hit
quite as hard as this latest track from her. There&#8242;s something supremely
whimsical about the song across its colorful synth lead or Sarah&#8242;s vocals
that are throwing it back to some of the art pop greats (I immediately think of
Kate Bush when I hear these types of sounds).</p>

<p class=maintext>Over the last few weeks, she has been increasingly teasing
toward a new album to be released this year, though details are still trickling
as I write this section. Most recently, the second single <b><i>Lonely Touch</i></b>
can be expected as of next week, so you best believe I&#8242;ll keep an eye out
for it.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=95 height=95 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)" 
	src="Albums/LEXA GATES - I AM.jpg"
align=left hspace=12
alt="A cover of a album&#10;&#10;AI-generated content may be incorrect.">Lexa
Gates - I Am</p>

<p class=firstline>Here&#8242;s an album that I&#8242;m eagerly looking forward
to in the next two weeks.</p>

<p class=maintext>If you&#8242;re not familiar with Lexa Gates by now, don&#8242;t
worry. She&#8242;s been steadily releasing music within the 2020s, and I found
out about her work through 2024&#8242;s <b><i>Elite Vessel</i></b>. Though I
wasn&#8242;t blown away by the album back then (in fact, I remember describing
it as &#8242;sloshy&#8242; at the time), it gradually grew on me over the last
year. I even placed one of its songs on my year-end list of best tracks in 2024,
so opinions do change.</p>

<p class=maintext>Opinions change even faster when the music starts to click.
Over the course of 2025, Lexa released 4 new singles during the leadup to this
new album, and I&#8242;m happy to report that I&#8242;ve enjoyed every single
one. <b><i>Latency</i></b> was a neat little jam that I listened to a lot
during the summer, <b><i>Past It</i></b> features this really interesting
chipmunk soul instrumental that sounds incredible, <b><i>Nothing to Worry About</i></b>
highlights Lexa&#8242;s signature deep voice rap-singing, and most recently <b><i>Estranged</i></b>
has one of the more unique song progressions she&#8242;s used so far.</p>

<p class=maintext>All in all, I can definitely classify this among my top 5
most anticipated releases of the year!</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=95 height=95 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)" 
	src="Albums/CONVERGE - (2025) LOVE IS NOT ENOUGH.jpg"
align=left hspace=12
alt="A cover of a album&#10;&#10;AI-generated content may be incorrect.">Converge
- Love Is Not Enough</p>

<p class=firstline>As far as metal albums go, the new Converge release is
easily the one I&#8242;m looking forward to the most in 2026!</p>

<p class=maintext>To fans of the band, it really sounds like they&#8242;re operating
at a level as intense and ferocious as ever, especially on the title track that
they released late in 2025 to tease this full album. To me, it&#8242;s kind of
obvious that this one is going to be a lock for a year-end list, which is why I&#8242;m
so excited to actually inject this into my ears when the time comes. Sometimes,
a little metalcore can go a long way.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=95 height=95 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)" 
	src="Singles/RAYE - WHERE IS MY HUSBAND.jpg"
align=left hspace=12
alt="A cover of a album&#10;&#10;AI-generated content may be incorrect.">RAYE</p>

<p class=firstline>One artist who made considerable waves in 2025 was RAYE. Though
she didn&#8242;t necessarily release much music at all, it&#8242;s been
fascinating to see her transform into a global phenomenon thanks to her
incredibly dynamic live performances backed by impressive jazz orchestrations.</p>

<p class=maintext>Needless to say, she has found her style, and she is sticking
to it on her latest single <b><i>WHERE IS MY HUSBAND</i></b>, a song that truly
speaks to her most charismatic side. Not only is it an incredibly ambitious
track on its own, but it&#8242;s seemingly opening up an album cycle that may
or may not occur within 2026. Let&#8242;s hope for the former, shall we?</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=95 height=95 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)" 
	src="Singles/DOECHII - GIRL GET UP.jpg"
align=left hspace=12
alt="A cover of a album&#10;&#10;AI-generated content may be incorrect.">Doechii</p>

<p class=firstline>At this point, Doechii isn&#8242;t an artist who requires an
introduction. Her come-up story has been nothing short of inspiring to watch
unfold, culminating in a Grammy victory for her 2024 mixtape <b><i>Alligator
Bites Never Heal</i></b>. Even I was immediately swooned by the versatility she
displayed on the project, with a lot of my highlights from it going on to
become chart-topping hits within the last year.</p>

<p class=maintext>However, skyrocketing to success so quickly came with a fair
share of drawbacks, notably within the form of serial Internet complainers
dismissing her talent as luck. Well, what a better way to snap back at her
dissenters then with the surprising new track <b><i>girl get up</i></b>, a song
released on December 30<sup>th</sup> that sounds like a victory lap and a
warning call all at the same time.</p>

<p class=maintext>And with a new album seemingly on the horizon, I&#8242;ll be
there on day one to hear what else she has to say.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=95 height=95 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)" 
	src="Singles/UNDERSCORES - MUSIC.jpg"
align=left hspace=12
alt="A cover of a album&#10;&#10;AI-generated content may be incorrect.">underscores</p>

<p class=firstline>I mean, this is an obvious pick for me, but you should know
how much I adore underscores&#8242; music by now. If I haven&#8242;t made that evident
through the innumerable references I&#8242;ve made to <b><i>Wallsocket</i></b>
in the last few years, then let me repeat myself again.</p>

<p class=maintext>Within the lane of modern pop music, no one is as exciting of
a producer to me as April herself. She has a way of creating these super sticky
melodic earworms unlike any other artist I could think of. You can hear evidence
of this on her recent contributions to the new Danny Brown album, be it the
super poppy <b><i>Copycats</i></b> or the much darker and more technical <b><i>Baby</i></b>.</p>

<p class=maintext>This last track also seems to emulate a lot of the energy and
sonic components featured in the latest underscores singles <b><i>Music</i></b>
and <b><i>Do It</i></b>, both of which are kind of aligning in a way that feels
very album-like. From the matching fonts in the cover arts to the similar sound
style she is aiming for, I&#8242;m slowly but surely charging up my excitement
for a full album sometime in 2026.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=95 height=95 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)" 
	src="Albums/GORILLAZ - THE MOUNTAIN.jpg"
align=left hspace=12
alt="A cover of a album&#10;&#10;AI-generated content may be incorrect.">Gorillaz
- The Mountain</p>

<p class=firstline>Of course, another safe pick is the upcoming Gorillaz album.
Entering this latest era with a handful of singles incorporating features the
likes of Sparks, IDLES, and Yasiin Bey, the band is doing what they typically
do best through these interesting genre combinations that seek to mold pop into
something greater than its intended purpose.</p>

<p class=maintext>While I did enjoy many tracks off the band&#8242;s 2023 album
<b><i>Cracker Island</i></b>, I&#8242;d love to hear them take things back to a
more refined conceptual direction like on their very classic <b><i>Plastic
Beach</i></b>, an album I still hold in a high regard today as being their
best. With the stacked feature list they presented, I&#8242;m sure it&#8242;s a
tangible goal.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=95 height=95 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)" 
	src="Albums/JOJI - PISS IN THE WIND.jpg"
align=left hspace=12
alt="A cover of a album&#10;&#10;AI-generated content may be incorrect.">Joji -
Piss in the Wind</p>

<p class=firstline>An artist that we haven&#8242;t heard of in a while has to
be Joji, who seems to be ramping up toward some big comeback. Over the course
of 2025, he released several singles, most of them running quite a bit short
time-wise.</p>

<p class=maintext>I&#8242;ll be honest, most of these songs rang more like
motifs than they did actual finished tracks, so I guess I&#8242;ll have to wait
and see how well they work within an album context. If anything, I really loved
the most recent single <b><i>Love You Less</i></b> above all the other ones. It
has this really cool mix of ambient sounds and shoegaze aesthetics that makes
me look forward to whatever Joji seems to be cooking this year.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=95 height=95 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)" 
	src="Singles/DANGER MOUSE & BLACK THOUGHT - UP.jpg"
align=left hspace=12
alt="A cover of a album&#10;&#10;AI-generated content may be incorrect.">Danger
Mouse &amp; Black Thought - Cheat Codes 2</p>

<p class=firstline>Okay, maybe this one is a bit of a shot in the dark, but I
do hope this prediction comes to fruition. In 2022, Danger Mouse &amp; Black
Thought collaborated to create one of my favorite hip-hop albums of the decade
so far, that being <b><i>Cheat Codes</i></b>. It was such a wonderful
combination of old-school boom bap with verses by some legendary rappers, and I
still listen to it as often as it comes to mind.</p>

<p class=maintext>With that being said, the duo released the song <b><i>Up</i></b>
in 2025 which features a similar thematic branding and style to the previous
album. Maybe I&#8242;m reaching a bit here, but I&#8242;d love for this single
to be the catalyst to a potential sequel album.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album>Olivia Rodrigo - OR3</p>

<p class=firstline>Again, this might be a bit of a reach, but I definitely
wouldn&#8242;t mind a new Olivia Rodrigo album in 2026. It&#8242;s hard for me
to ignore just how much <b><i>Sour</i></b> and <b><i>Guts</i></b> have grown on
me over the last few years. I know I liked them at the time but, even
lyrically, I&#8242;m just very impressed by the persona she built for herself
through her music and style. With all that said, I have a feeling her next
album might just be her best yet if she continues expanding creatively at the
pace that she has so far.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=95 height=95 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)" 
	src="Albums/LADYTRON - PARADISES.jpg"
align=left hspace=12
alt="A cover of a album&#10;&#10;AI-generated content may be incorrect.">Ladytron
- Paradises</p>

<p class=firstline>Maybe this is a band that&#8242;s gone a bit overlooked
lately, but I&#8242;m still very much excited to hear this full album. I
remember discovering Ladytron back in 2023 through their album <b><i>Time&#8242;s
Arrow</i></b>, and that one proved to be a grower for me during that year.
Already with the singles we&#8242;ve gotten, it&#8242;s sounding like a much headier
and more thematic listen than I would&#8242;ve expected.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=95 height=95 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)" 
	src="Singles/THUNDERCAT - CHILDREN OF THE BAKED POTATO.jpg"
align=left hspace=12
alt="A cover of a album&#10;&#10;AI-generated content may be incorrect.">Thundercat</p>

<p class=firstline>Perhaps he was just playing around with sounds in 2025, or
maybe he was leading up to an album. It&#8242;s hard to tell for sure...</p>

<p class=maintext>What I can say is that I&#8242;d love to hear <b><i>I Wish I
Didn&#8242;t Waste Your Time</i></b> and <b><i>Children of the Baked Potato</i></b>
land on an official Thundercat album. That latter song is especially zany with
great vocal contributions by Remi Wolf, leading me to wish for even more
eccentric collaborations on future tracks.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album><img width=95 height=95 style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255)" 
	src="Singles/FEEBLE LITTLE HORSE - THIS IS REAL.jpg"
align=left hspace=12
alt="A cover of a album&#10;&#10;AI-generated content may be incorrect.">feeble
little horse</p>

<p class=firstline>Come on now! <b><i>This Is Real</i></b> is way too good of a
song to not be a lead single for an upcoming album. Look, I know it released
super early in 2025 and we haven&#8242;t had any updates from the band since
then, but let me be optimistic for greatness. We can use more dreamers in this
world.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album>Baby Keem</p>

<p class=firstline>Speaking of dreams, I think it&#8242;s about time for a new
Baby Keem album. I mean, I&#8242;m still hanging onto <b><i>The Melodic Blue</i></b>
for dear life right now; I could really use a supplement of new material any
day now. I&#8242;ll even take another <b><i>Hillbillies</i></b> with Kendrick if
that&#8242;s what it&#8242;ll take!</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album>My bloody valentine</p>

<p class=firstline>And it&#8242;s pretty much at this point in the list where I
get on my knees and start praying for artists to return. I know I&#8242;m not
the only one who needs new MBV badly, but I think we need to collectively start
begging to wish a new era of music into existence.</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<p class=album>Frank Ocean</p>

<p class=firstline>Please... Pretty please, I&#8242;ll take anything. He&#8242;s
going to come back this year, I just know it. He has to come back... He just has
to...</p>

<p class=a>* * *</p>

<h2>Basically...</h2>

<p class=firstline>...that&#8242;s the short list of artists I&#8242;ve
compiled that I really want to hear more from in 2026. Obviously, I didn&#8242;t
capture the entire scope of my favorite artists, but I narrowed it roughly to
my most anticipated at the moment.</p>

<p class=maintext>I suppose we&#8242;ll have to wait as 2026 unfolds to see how
many of my predictions / copious wishes come true. Here&#8242;s to another
great year for new music to discover!</p>
